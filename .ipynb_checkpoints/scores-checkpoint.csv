"Swelling in popularity in the first quarter of 2021, this year seems to be the year of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as prolific celebrities, athletes, and musicians poured into the space awash with buzz and excitement over the revolutionary creative possibilities the nascent ecosystem presented.  
Ever since it's conception, the attention of the NFT space has been focused primarily on digital art and collectibles. Platforms such as OpenSea and Rarible currently capture a lion's share of NFT minting and selling.  


However, what is often overlooked is that NFTs aren't just about digital collectibles. There are so many more use cases and innovative applications of NFTs. Here are 5 platforms that are more than just digital collectibles in the NFT space. 

1) [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) v3: Uniswap is the largest decentralized exchange for digital currencies. The newest version, called Uniswap v3, allows liquidity providers to allocate liquidity to one or more closed intervals of the price of an asset, instead of over the total range of prices. Due to the increased complexity of liquidity provision for v3, these NFTs present a simpler alternative to ERC20 liquidity tokens. 

2) [Drops](https://drops.co/): Drops is a new protocol that is designed to leverage NFTs as a collateral for loans. Designed with the future of financial NFTs in mind, Drops aims to optimize the utility of NFT assets to minimize their opportunity cost and maximize the returns of holding them. This platform enables you to get more leverage out of your assets for loans and yield-farming. 

3) [Solv Protocol](https://solv.finance/): By creating a brand-new token standard for Financial NFTs, Solv has made NFTs Computable. They allow users to create 'vouchers' that represent unique investment allocations, bonds, deposit receipts, cover notes and more. Vouchers can be used to release the liquidity of lock-up assets, as well as control distribution in the form of transfer, trading and lending. 

4) [Unifty](https://unifty.io): Unifty is a multi-chain infrastructure platform, focusing on the creator economy. They focus on developing, and enabling fully decentralized no-code solutions for creators, with all things, and services around the NFT space. Users can mint, buy, sell, swap, and create NFTs and NFT farms with just a few clicks, while fully owning their contracts. 

5) [Charged Particles](https://charged.fi/): Charged Particles Protocol allows users to deposit any ERC tokens into any Non-Fungible Token (NFT). This leads to the creation of 'baskets' of multiple tokens. This can include interest-generating tokens, creating some of the very first interest-earning NFT assets.",0.011,0.872,0.117,0.9901

**Consumer Friendly DeFi Apps** 

There is significant learning curve to accessing DeFi apps like UniSwap. The UI/UX of most DeFi apps are still quite difficult to use from a consumer perspective. Apps like Trust Wallet try to bridge that with a dApp web-based browser but a full-fledged consumer friendly DeFi App would be an area to look into. There are some early developments here but also a lot of gaps.

**Notifications** 

There is a lack of notifications or alerts within the  DeFi space. There is also a difficulty in being able to communicate with users of these DeFi apps.

**Transaction Rollbacks** 

A controversial one. However, in tradfi, if you make a mistake, a financial institution can start a rollback of that transaction. This does not yet exist in DeFi. Is there a middle ground or an opportunity to provide an extra layer of safety to the user.

**Analytics** 

There are a lot of tools available for managing and tracking blockchain usage. There is a lack of such tools within the DeFi space for tracking engagement - especially now that we are seeing DeFi apps integrating game-ification and gambling style applications.

**Security** 

Most reputable DeFi apps conduct security audits; however, none of these  audits guarantee the most basic protections consumers are used to in the tradfi world. Additionally, the demand for auditors outstrips the supply, so it’s a big bottleneck and audits can takes several weeks. I know many people are still fearful or have had bad experiences interacting with DeFi apps so there is a room for improvement.

**Customer Relationship Management**

The DeFi space doesn’t yet have a strong concept of CRM nor typically collects any kind of consumer data. This is good from a privacy perspective but there is definitely a middle ground and great value in understanding the customer better. There is so much data on blockchain scanners that can be utilised and improved upon to make it more accessible.

**Identity** 

Is there a way to keep out the bad actors from the crypto space while persevering consumer privacy. Is there a middle ground for identity management. This is related to all other aspects I think.",0.068,0.771,0.16,0.9903

"Everyone got their own opinion and i personally think moons are awesome and a nice incentive to engage in the sub, i understand some other people who say that they think moons are a shitcoin, they have some good points but still i do think that moons are a gamechanger and an excellent experiment.

&amp;#x200B;

*   moons are centralised but they are still in the development phase and basically still an experiment. Centralisation is necessary to allow their distribution to us and i think that as moons get more use-cases they can become more akin to a decentralised cryptocurrency
* moons have literally changed the lives of many on this sub, people who share how they can pay some of their bills with them is a great example of how crypto can influence this society positively
* the mods of this sub are indeed paid in moons to do a job near all other mods on Reddit do for free, but i think mod jobs take time and are not the most fun thing to do. Then again getting over half a million moons might be a bit overboard as that like 50K $, but still first come first serve i suppose, and whales are existent in every crypto. 
*  Eventhough moon posts occupy a large chunk of the focus of attention on this sub, there are so many other articles and posts that it does not really matter, in fact you can simply ignore the moon posts if you want and there is still a great amount of usefull posts out there.
*  Moons have allowed for a democratic system to develop in which people vote for the future of this sub and moons themselves. I myself have never been part of a DAO and as such think this is a great entry point to such projects and really like voting and seeing changes implemented.
*  moons are a beautiful coin, and the name is awesome their value is also insane considering ATH was 46 cents!!!

"•51% Attack

If more than half the computer power on a network is run by a single person or a single group of people, then a 51% attack is in operation. This means this entity has full control of the network and can negatively affect a cryptocurrency by halting mining, stopping or changing transactions, and reusing coins.

•Addresses

Every cryptocurrency coin has a unique address that identifies where it sits on the blockchain. It’s this address, this location, at which the coin’s ownership data is stored and where any changes are registered when it is traded. These addresses differ in appearance between cryptocurrencies but are usually a string of more than 30 characters.

•Airdrop

This is a marketing campaign that refers to the expedited distribution of a cryptocurrency through a population of people. It usually occurs when the creator of a cryptocurrency provides its coin to low-ranked traders or existing community members in order to build their use and popularity. They are usually given away for free or in exchange for simple tasks like sharing news of the coin with friends.

•Algorithm

•ASIC

Acronym for “Application Specific Integrated Circuit”

•ATH

Acronym for “All Time High”

•ATL

•Bear/Bearish

If the price of a cryptocurrency has a negative price movement.

•Bear Trap

This is a trick played by a group of traders aimed at manipulating the price of a cryptocurrency. The bear trap is set by this group all selling their cryptocurrency at the same time, which bluffs the market into thinking there is a drop incoming. As a result, other traders sell their assets, further driving the price down. Those who set the trap then release it, buying back their assets, which are now at a lower price. The overall price then rebounds, allowing them to make a profit.

•Bitcoin

The very first cryptocurrency. It was created in 2008 by an individual or group of individuals operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It was intended to be a peer-to-peer, decentralized electronic cash system.

•Block

•Block Height

Refers to the number of blocks connected in the blockchain. For example, Height 0 would be the very first block, which is also called the genesis block.

•Block Reward

A form of incentive for the miner who successfully calculates the hash (verification) in a block. Verification of transactions on the blockchain generates new coins in the process, and the miner is rewarded with a portion of these.

•Blockchain

The blockchain is a digital ledger of all the transactions ever made in a particular cryptocurrency. It’s comprised of individual blocks (see definition above) that are chained to each other through a cryptographic signature. Each time a block’s capacity is reached, a new block is added to the chain. The blockchain is repeatedly copied and saved onto thousands of computers all around the world, and it must always match each copy. As there is no master copy stored in one location, it’s considered decentralized.

•BTFD

Acronym for “Buy The Fuckinf Dip”

•Bull/Bullish

If the price of a cryptocurrency has a positive price movement.

•Burned

If a coin in any particular cryptocurrency has been made unspendable, it is said to be burned.

•Buy the F$%king Dip

A less-than-savory phrase used when you’re (enthusiastically) telling someone a currency has dipped to a low value and should be bought.

•Buy Wall

When a large limit order has been placed to buy when a cryptocurrency reaches a certain value, then that is a buy wall. This can prevent a cryptocurrency from falling below that value, as demand will likely outstrip supply when the order is executed.

•CAP

Shorthand for market capitalization (see definition below)

•Central Ledger

When a single entity has control of all financial records, it is considered to be a central ledger. This is how banks operate.

•Chain Linking

Each cryptocurrency has its own blockchain – the digital ledger that stores all transaction records. Chain linking is the process that occurs if you transfer one cryptocurrency to another. This requires the transaction to be lodged in two separate blockchains, so they must link together to achieve the goal.

•Cipher

The name given to the algorithm that encrypts and decrypts information.

•Circulating Supply

The total number of coins in a cryptocurrency that are in the publicly tradable space is considered the circulating supply. Some coins can be locked, reserved or burned, therefore unavailable to public trading.

•Cold Storage

Another term used for a paper wallet (see below).

•Confirmed

When a transaction has been confirmed, it means it has been approved by the network and permanently appended to the blockchain.

•Consensus

When a transaction is made, all nodes on the network verify that it is valid on the blockchain, and if so, they have a consensus.

•Consensus Process

Refers to those nodes that are responsible for maintaining the blockchain ledger so that a consensus can be reached when a transaction is made.

•Consortium blockchain

A privately owned and operated, yet publicly transparent, blockchain.

•Cryptocurrency

A form of money that exists as encrypted, digital information. Operating independently of any banks, a cryptocurrency uses sophisticated mathematics to regulate the creation and transfer of funds between entities.

Cryptographic Hash Function
•
This process happens on a node and involves converting an input – such as a transaction – into a fixed, encrypted alphanumeric string that registers its place in the blockchain. This conversion is controlled by a hashing algorithm, which is different for each cryptocurrency.

•Cryptography

The process of encrypting and decrypting information.

•DAO

Acronym for “decentralized autonomous organization”

•dApp

Shorthand for “decentralized application”

•Decentralized Autonomous Organization

Refers to organizations that are run by an application (computer program) rather than direct human input. Control of this application is granted to everyone rather than a single central entity.

•Decryption

Turning encrypted cipher text back into plain text.

•Deflation

When the demand for a particular cryptocurrency decreases, bringing down the price of its economy.

•Depth Chart

This graph plots the requests to buy (known as bids) and the requests to sell (known as asks) on a chart. Because you can put a limit order on your buy or sell transaction, the depth chart shows the crossover point at which the market is most likely to accept a transaction in a timely fashion. It also shows if there are any significant buy walls or sell walls in play.

•Deterministic Wallet

This type of wallet is created by producing multiple keys from a seed. If you lose this wallet, your wallet key can be recovered from the seed. Plus, when you make transactions, instead of producing new keys each time, you use variations from the seed, which makes it more transferable and easier to store.

•Difficulty

When someone refers to difficulty in the cryptocurrency space, they are referring to the cost of mining in that moment in time. The more transactions that are trying to be confirmed at any single moment in time, divided by the total power of the nodes on the network at that time, defines the difficulty. The higher the difficulty, the greater the transaction fee – this is a fluid measurement that moves over time.

•Digital Commodity

An intangible, hard-to-get asset that is transferred electronically and has a certain value.

•Digital Currency

Another term for digital commodity

•Digital Signature

Used to confirm that a document being transmitted electronically is authentic. They generally appear as a code generated by a public key encryption.

•Distributed Ledger

A ledger that is stored in multiple locations so that any entries can be accessed and checked by multiple parties. In cryptocurrency, this refers to the blockchain being held on multiple nodes on the network, all of which are checked simultaneously.

•Double Spend

This occurs when someone tries to send a cryptocurrency to two different wallets or locations at the same time.

•Dump

The term used to describe selling all (or a lot) of your cryptocurrency.

•Dumping

•Escrow

When an intermediary is used to hold funds during a transaction, those funds are being held in escrow. This is usually a third party between the entity sending and the one receiving.

•Ethereum

One of the top three cryptocurrencies in the world based on its market capitalization. Despite being open source and based on blockchain technology, it differs from bitcoin in two key ways: it allows developers to create dApps and also write smart contracts.

•Ethereum Virtual Machine

A virtual machine, effectively sitting in the cloud, that is Turing complete and is used by all nodes on the network during blockchain confirmations. It allows those on the node to execute random EVM Byte Code, which is part of the Ethereum Protocol.

•EVM

•FOMO

An acronym for “fear of missing out”.

•Fork

When a new version of a blockchain is created, resulting in two versions of the blockchain running side-by-side, it is termed a fork. As a single blockchain forks into two, they will both run on the same network. Forks are categorized into two categories: soft or hard.

•Frictionless

If there is no transaction cost and no restraints on trading, then the system is considered frictionless.

•FUD

Acronym for “fear, uncertainty and doubt”.

•Full Node

Some nodes download a blockchain’s entire history in order to enforce its rules completely. As they fully enforce the rules, they are considered a full node.

•Fundamental Analysis

A method through which you can attach value to a coin by looking at similar economic and financial factors and researching the underlying motives of the creators and market opinion.

•Futures Contract

This is a pre-approved contract between two entities to fulfill a transaction when the value of cryptocurrency hits a certain price. It’s different than a limit order in that the buyer and seller are already nominated and bound. A future contract becomes relevant when a buyer wants to go short and a seller wants to go long on the asset.

•Gas

Gas a is measurement given to an operation in the Ethereum network that relates to the computational power required to complete it. That measurement relates to the fee offered to miners who process that transaction. Other operations have a small cost of 3 to 10 gas, but a full transaction costs 21,000 gas.

•Gas Limit

When users make a transaction on the Ethereum network, they set their gas limit, which is the most they are willing to pay as a fee for that transaction. If the transaction is going to cost more gas than what is offered, the transaction will not go through. If it costs less, the difference will be refunded.

•Gas Price

The amount you are willing to pay for a transaction on the Ethereum network. If you want miners to process your transaction fast, then you should offer a higher price. Gas prices are usually denominated in Gwei.

°Genesis Block

The first or first few blocks of a blockchain.

•Group Mining

Another term used to describe a mining pool (see below).

•Gwei

The denomination used in defining the cost of gas. Set a gas price of 20,000 Gwei, for example.

•Halving

Every time miners approve transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, they earn bitcoin. As each block on the blockchain fills up with transactions, a certain amount of bitcoin enter the marketplace. However, the number of bitcoin that will ever be created is finite, locked at 21 million. In order to ensure this cap is kept, the amount of bitcoin earned by miners for filling one block is halved at the completion of that block. This is called halving. For the record, by the year 2140, all 21 million bitcoin will be in circulation.

•Hard Cap

During an ICO, the creator can set a hard cap. This is the maximum amount it planned to raise, and it will therefore stop offering coins at this figure.

•Hard Fork

A fork in the blockchain that converts transactions previously labeled invalid to valid, and vice versa. For this fork to work, all nodes on the network must upgrade to the newest protocol.

•Hardware Wallet

A physical device, similar to a USB stick, that stores cryptocurrency in its encrypted form. It’s considered the most secure way to hold cryptocurrency.

•Hash

The shorthand for cryptographic hash function (see description above).

•Hash Rate

Measurement of performance that reveals how many hashes per second your computer is capable of producing. Each hash is an attempt to find a block by creating a unique block candidate and testing it against the network.

•Hashing Power

The hash rate of a computer, measured in kH/s, MH/s, GH/s, TH/s, PH/s or EH/s depending on the hashes per second being produced. 1,000 kH/s = 1 MH/s, 1,000 MH/s = 1 GH/s and so forth.

•HODL

Acronym for “hold on for dear life”.

•Ledger

A record of financial transactions. A ledger cannot be changed, it can only be appended with new transactions.

•Leverage

A loan of sorts offered by a broker on an exchange during margin trading (see below).

•Lightning Network

A peer-to-peer system for cryptocurrency micropayments that is focused on low latency, instant payments. They’re typically low cost, scalable and can work across chains, and transactions can be public or private.

•Limit Order/Limit Buy/Limit Sell

If you set a rule whereby a cryptocurrency is sold or bought when at a certain price, you are setting a limit order. When traders place an order for a buy or sell, the system looks for these limit orders.

•Liquidity

The liquidity of a cryptocurrency is defined by how easily it can be bought and sold without impacting the overall market price.

•Locktime

If a transaction request comes with a rule delaying when it can be processed to a certain time or certain block on the blockchain, that is referred to as the locktime.

•Long

When you intend to take a large amount of cryptocurrency and stockpile it with the anticipation that it will grow in value, you are going long (or taking a long position).

•MACD

Acronym for “Moving Average Convergence Divergence”.

•Margin Bear Position

This is the position you are taking if you are going “short”.

•Margin Bull Position

This is the position you are taking if you are going “long”.

•Market Capitalization

This is defined as the total number of coins in supply multiplied by the price. Cap = supply x price.

•Margin Trading

A risky strategy used by experienced traders where they risk their existing coins to magnify the intensity of their trades. This allows them to buy more than they can afford using leverage provided by an exchange.

•Market Order

As opposed to a limit order, a market order does not wait until a certain price to buy or sell; it trades wherever the price is at the time the transaction order is made.

•MCAP

Acronym for “market capitalization”.

•Mining

The term, somewhat confusingly, given to the process of verifying transactions on a blockchain. In the process of solving the encryption challenges, the person donating the computer power is granted new fractions of the cryptocurrency.

•Mining Contract

An investment in mining hardware whereby you rent out the hashing power of mining hardware for a certain amount of time. The renter does not pay for the hardware or the maintenance and electricity required to run it.

•Mining Pool

If a number of miners combine their computing power together to try and help complete the transactions required to start a new block in the blockchain, they are in a mining pool. The rewards are spread proportionately between those in the mining pool based on the amount of power they contributed. The idea is that being in a mining pool allows for better chances of successful hashing and therefore getting enough cryptocurrency reward to produce an income.

•Money Services Business

A legal term used to represent an entity that transfers or converts money.

•Moon

A term used to describe a major price movement upwards. For example, Ripple is mooning.

•Moving Average Convergence Divergence

A part of the technical analysis of a cryptocurrency’s value, this tracks the momentum of price change to try and forecast into the future.

•MSB

Acronym for “money services business”.

•Multipool Mining

If a miner moves from one cryptocurrency blockchain to another depending on the profitability provided by the network at that moment in time, they are engaging in multipool mining.

•Multi-Signature (Multi-Sig) Wallets

If, in order for a transaction to go through, more than one user needs to provide their unique code, then it is multi-signature. This system is set up at the creation of the account and is considered less susceptible to theft.

•Network

A network refers to all the nodes committed to helping the operation of a blockchain at any given moment in time.

•Node

Any computer that is connected to a blockchain’s network is referred to as a node.

•Nonce

When a miner hashes a transaction, a random number is generated, called a nonce. The parameters from which that number is chosen change based on the difficulty of the transaction.

•OCO

Acronym for “one cancels the other order”.

•One Cancels the Other Order

When two orders for cryptocurrency are placed simultaneously with a rule in place whereby if one is accepted, the other is cancelled.

•Oracles

The smart contracts stored on a blockchain are stuck within the network. They can only be reached by the external world through a program called an oracle. The oracle sends the data to and from the smart contract and the outside world as required. Oracles are most commonly found on the Ethereum network.

•Overbought

If a large number of purchases have been made on a cryptocurrency, its price will increase for an extended period of time. At this juncture, it is considered overbought and a period of selling is expected.

•Oversold

If a cryptocurrency has spent significant time being sold without an upward movement, it is considered oversold. In this condition, there would be concerns about whether it will bounce back.

•Paper Wallet

Storing your wallet code (your private key) on a physical document makes it a paper wallet. It’s also sometimes referred to as cold storage.

•P2P

Acronym for “peer to peer”.

•Peer to Peer

In a peer-to-peer connection, two or more computers network with each other without a centralized third party being used as an intermediary.

•PND

Acronym for “pump and dump”.

•Pre-Sale

A period before an ICO goes public when private investors or community members are able to buy the cryptocurrency.

•Private Key

A string of numbers and letters that are used to access your wallet. While your wallet is represented by a public key, the private key is the password you should protect (with your life). You need your private key when selling or withdrawing cryptocurrencies, as it acts as your digital signature. NEVER SHARE THIS WITH ANYONE.

•Proof of Authority (PoA)

A private key that gives the holder the right to create the blocks in a private blockchain. It can be held by a single entity or a set number of entities. This is an alternative to the proof-of-work model, as instead of getting multiple random nodes to approve a transaction, a group of specific nodes are given the authority to approve. This is a far faster method.

•Proof of Stake (PoS)

Another alternative to proof of work, this caps the reward given to miners for providing their computational power to the network at that miner’s investment in the cryptocurrency. So if a miner holds three coins, they can only earn three coins. The system encourages miners to stick with a certain blockchain rather than converting their rewards to an alternate cryptocurrency.

•Proof of Work (PoW)

In order to receive a reward for mining a cryptocurrency, miners must show that their computers contributed effort to approve a transaction. A variable is added to the process of hashing a transaction that demands that effort before a block can be successfully hashed. Having a hashed block proves the miner did work and deserves a reward – hence proof of work.

•Protocols

The set of rules that defines how data is exchanged across a network.

•Public blockchain

A blockchain that can be accessed by anyone through a full node on their computer.

•Public Key

This is your unique wallet address, which appears as a long string of numbers and letters. It is used to receive cryptocurrencies.

•Pump

This is a term used to refer to an upward price movement, usually driven by whales investing large sums of money in a cryptocurrency.

•Pump and Dump

The frowned-upon practice of buying a lot of one cryptocurrency to drive up its price and encourage others to invest, then selling the lot when there is a suitable margin.

•REKT

Shorthand slang for “wrecked” and a term used to describe a bad loss in a trade.

•Relative Strength Index

A type of technical analysis whereby you determine the momentum of price change over time. It looks at recent changes in price exponentially, with the most recent changes given more weight than older ones. This produces an overall trend of movement for a cryptocurrency that can determine if the market is overbought (a reading higher than 70) or oversold (a reading lower than 30).

•Ring Signature

A ring signature is a type of encryption process that retains anonymity for the user. The concept gives the network of nodes the power to approve a transaction on a blockchain without identifying which of the nodes requested the transaction. As a result, it cannot be traced.

•RSI

Acronym for “Relative Strength Index”.

•Satoshi Nakamoto

The individual, or group of individuals – it has never been confirmed – who created bitcoin.

•SATS

This is the smallest unit of bitcoin, which is 0.00000001 BTC. The name SATS is shorthand for Satoshi Nakamoto, which is the fake name used by the creator of bitcoin.

•Scrypt

An algorithm that encrypts a key in such a fashion that it takes a serious amount of RAM to hash it. The system makes it challenging to attack for hackers. Despite its spelling, Scrypt is pronounced “ess-crypt”.

•Seed

The origin point from which you created your wallet ID. Usually, a seed is a phrase or a series of words that can be used to regenerate your wallet ID if you lose it. Something to keep very secret.

•Segregated Witness

The processes of separating digital signature data from transaction data. This lets more transactions fit onto one block in the blockchain, improving transaction speeds.

•SEGWIT

Acronym for “segregated witness”.

•Selfish Mining

If a miner finds or creates a new block in the blockchain and then doesn’t share that information with the network, he or she is partaking in selfish mining. This is because other miners are now burning their computational power on an old block, allowing the selfish miner to get a head start on the new block.

•Sell Wall

When a large limit order has been placed to sell when a cryptocurrency reaches a certain value, that is a sell wall. This can prevent a cryptocurrency from rising above that value, as supply will likely outstrip demand when the order is executed.

•SHA-256

The name of the cryptographic hash function (the hashing algorithm) used by bitcoin. It’s been subsequently used by a number of altcoins too.

•Sharding

Sharding is a way of splitting up the full blockchain history so each full node doesn’t need the whole copy of it. It’s considered a scaling solution for blockchains because as they grow larger, it begins to slow the network performance if every node is required to carry the full blockchain.

•Shit Coin

No points for guessing this one. It’s a term used to describe a cryptocurrency not expected to have a positive future.

•Short

Also known as short selling, this is a concept whereby traders sell an asset they don’t have. The hope is that they can then buy the asset at a lower price than which they sold it to complete the deal. Thereby they earn a margin in the interim.

•Smart Contracts

When a contract is written in computer code, as opposed to traditional legal language, it is deemed a smart contract. This programmed contract is set up to execute and carry itself out automatically under specified conditions. When a smart contract is on the blockchain, both parties can check its programming before agreeing to it, and then let it do its thing, confident that it cannot be tampered with or changed. It lets two parties agree to complex terms without needing to trust each other and without needing to involve any third parties. This functionality is the defining feature of the Ethereum blockchain.

•Soft Fork

A fork in a blockchain protocol where previously valid transactions become invalid. A soft fork is backwards-compatible, as the old nodes running the old protocol will still consider new transactions valid, rather than disregarding them. For a soft fork to work, a majority of the miners powering the network will need to upgrade to the new protocol.

•Software Wallet

A common form of wallet where the private key for an individual is stored within software files on a computer. This is the system you are likely to use if you sign up for a wallet online that is not associated with an exchange.

•Solidity

A programming language similar to JavaScript but focused on developing smart contracts. It’s exported as bytecode, which is used by the Ethereum Virtual Machine that runs the Ethereum network.

•TA

Acronym for “technical analysis”.

•Technical Analysis

Using a trading tool to look at historical data on a cryptocurrency in the hope of forecasting its future.

•Test Net

When a cryptocurrency creator is testing out a new version of a blockchain, it does so on a test net. This runs like a second version of the blockchain but doesn’t impact the value associated with the primary, active blockchain.

•Timestamp

The moment in time when a transaction was encrypted and regarded as proof that the data compiled in that transaction existed.

•Token

The “coin” of a cryptocurrency is a token. Effectively, it’s the digital code defining each fraction, which can be owned, bought and sold.

•Tokenless Ledger

When a distributed ledger exists but doesn’t need a currency in which to operate. With these blockchains, the miners upholding the network typically don’t get a reward/payment.

•TOR

Acronym for “terms of reference”.

•Transaction

The value of cryptocurrency moved from one entity to another on a blockchain network.

•Transaction Fee

Usually very small fees given to the miners involved in successfully approving a transaction on the blockchain. This fee can vary depending on the difficulty involved in a transaction and overall network capabilities at that moment in time. If an exchange is involved in facilitating that transaction, it could also take a cut of the overall transaction fee.

•Turing Completeness

If a machine is capable of performing all conceivable programmable calculations, then it is Turing complete. This machine can process any computable function and includes most modern computers.

•Unconfirmed

When a transaction is proposed, it is unconfirmed until the network has examined the blockchain to ensure that there are no other transactions pending involving that same coin. In the unconfirmed state, the transaction has not been appended to the blockchain.

•Unspent Transaction Output

This refers to the amount of cryptocurrency sent to an entity but not sent on elsewhere. These amounts are considered unspent and are the data stored in the blockchain.

•UTXO

Acronym for “unspent transaction output”.

•Volatility

The fluctuation in an asset’s price is measured by its volatility. Cryptocurrency prices are notoriously volatile compared to other assets, as dramatic price shifts can happen quickly.

•Wallet

A wallet is defined by a unique code that represents its “address” on the blockchain. The wallet address is public, but within it is a number of private keys determining ownership of the balance and the balance itself. It can exist in software, hardware, paper or other forms.

•Whale

A term used to describe extremely wealthy investors or traders who have enough funds to manipulate the market.

•Whitelist

Prior to an ICO, interested parties can sign up/register their involvement and intent to purchase or even purchase under pre-sale conditions. The list of these parties is referred to as the whitelist.

•White Paper

A detailed explanation of a cryptocurrency, designed to offer satisfactory technical information, explain the purpose of the coin and set out a roadmap for how it plans to succeed. It’s designed to convince investors that it’s a good choice ahead of an ICO.

•Zero Confirmation Transaction

Alternative phrasing for an unconfirmed transaction.

A huge list but useful and there are definitely some terms you should know if you start with crypto.

"A used going by the name QuantumMechanic made a post in 2011 called ""Proof of stake instead of proof of work"" where he introduced the world to a new concept he called PoS. Everything else is history, except he never got the credits for it. I will link hist post and paste it down below so you can read it.

Post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=27787.0

What he wrote:

&gt;I've got an idea, and I'm wondering if it's been discussed/ripped apart here yet:

&gt;I'm wondering if as bitcoins become more widely distributed, whether a transition from a proof of work based system to a proof of stake one might happen.  What I mean by proof of stake is that instead of your ""vote"" on the accepted transaction history being weighted by the share of computing resources you bring to the network, it's weighted by the number of bitcoins you can prove you own, using your private keys.

&gt;For those that don't want to be actively verifying transactions, and so that not all private keys need to be facing the network, votes could be delegated to other addresses via some kind of nonstandard Bitcoin transaction.  In this way, voting power would accumulate with trusted delegates instead of miners.  New bitcoins and transaction fees could be randomly and periodically distributed to delgates, weighted by the number of votes they've accumulated, thereby incentivising diversity of the delegates and direct voters.

&gt;If the implementation could be done, it proved to maintain at least a similar level of privacy and trustworthiness, and it only minimally complicated the UX, I'm thinking that a proof of stake based fork could out-compete a proof of work one due to much lower transaction fees, since its network wouldn't need to support the cost of the miners' computing resources.  (Note that the vote delegation scheme has bandwith/storage overhead that would offset these savings by some amount which would hopefully be relatively small.)

&gt;Some other potential improvements this system could offer:
Possibly quicker, more definite confirmation of transactions, depending on how it can be implemented.
The ""voting power"" may be more trustworty, since it would accumulate in a bottom-up fashion via a network of trust, instead of in the somewhat arbitrary way it accumulates now.  (Note the potential problem of vote-buying here.)
It would remove the physical point of failure of bitcoin mining equipment, which can be confiscated or made illegal to run.
It could be used to provide stakeholders a means of making their voices heard (via the delegated voting system it establishes) when it comes to proposals for software updates and protocol changes.

&gt;Anyway, I just wanted to throw the idea out here to see if there are any obvious reasons why it couldn't be implemented, and to hopefully spark a discussion amongst those better qualified than me.

&gt;Cheers.

"The latest stablecoin project on Binance Smart Chain is offering yields of around 40 per cent — daily.  Stablequant Finance launched yesterday and has attracted US$10 million in total.  

Yields on its farming pools were between 15,000 and 27,000 per cent per annum, or 40 to 70 per cent each day.  The project aims to be a “simple, stripped-down swap designed to be the go-to DEX for stablecoins”.  

Needless to say, investors are risking a devastating “rugpull” from unscrupulous investors in which they lose all their money. Stable Magnet, a project with similar aims, collapsed in a US$27 million rugpull last month.

"Here’s the short answer: no one really knows, but you can make educated guesses.

In a bull market, everyone’s a genius. The market is purely speculative right now, and completely irrational. You have multi-billion dollar valuations on projects with no working product. On the other hand, you have projects that are solving complex technical issues valued outside the top 100.

It’s the wild wild west, and you must do your own research, and don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.

With that said, I invest based on the following beliefs on where I see the market going, and they may be an unpopular opinion compared to the get rich quick schemes being circulated:

The blockchain/crypto space right now is still in its infancy, therefore, I think the best investments you can make right now are in infrastructural and protocols projects, which will help foster the development ecosystem of the entire industry. More devs = more growth and more projects.
It’s too early to invest in consumer focused projects (some exceptions apply). For example, would Facebook really be viable as a business when the internet was first introduced? No, not at all. The timing would be way too early. The industry hasn’t matured, the adoption isn’t there, and the foundational technology hasn’t gotten there yet. Will you make money investing into consumer focused coins? Sure, but do you think these coins will be around after a market crash? Highly unlikely.
I don’t believe coins that say they focus on a specific niche or use case have any real value. (ie: Dentacoin - extreme example, but for sake of argument) - Ask yourself this, why have another token that essentially is just executing smart contracts, if you can simply use Ethereum? There are lots of scams out there like this which sound like it’s a viable idea, but it’s really worthless. Aside from scams, you also have very inexperienced entrepreneurs who have misguided beliefs, or opportunists who simply are creating a token to run an ICO to capitalize on crowdfunding and raising millions of dollars out of thin air and a whitepaper.
I think there are certain industries that have a lot of synergy with, and can benefit immediately from blockchain technology, namely - Finance &amp; Logistics. Currently banking infrastructure is highly inefficient, and blockchain tech at its core provides digital trust, and eliminates counterparty-risk. The moment you can do that and you can increase liquidity and easily move money around the globe, the more money and time you can save. Same with logistics, there are real benefits that businesses can derive value from right now. Such as the traceability and guarantee of authenticity of goods in the supply chain, combating counterfeit goods, etc.
With those in mind, there are a only a few picks that I’ve narrowed down that I think are worthwhile, and have satisfied my criteria of:

Team - Is the team credible, and experienced enough to see the project through? Do they have any advisors or board members? Etc
Technology - What’s unique about their technology? Do they have a working product? Do they really need to use the blockchain or can they really just be using a database?
Token - What gives the token value? Are the economic structures of the network incentivizing an increase in value, therefore making it a good investment? What’s the distribution of tokens? How is it valued? What’s the circulation?
Timeline - What’s their roadmap like? Do they look like they have a good business strategy laid out? Are they prioritizing and executing on the right things?
Industry Adoption - Do they already have any partnerships or real world usage? What’s the benefit and value? Any case studies?
As always, do your own research, and best of luck!",0.044,0.766,0.19,0.9988

So i had measly 480 moons i decided to sell on kuyumcu ( the nano thing). I've set up a new wallet at [nault.cc](https://nault.cc) and somehow  i sent the nano payment in there in exchange for the moons. The problem is that i don't get to recieve it because the address has no representative yet (which i only got to have after getting some free nano on a faucet) but the problem is that i happened to sell my moons on kuyumcu before i had the representative thing figured out. Now there is no nano sent on the address that is supposed to be from my moons transaction. Is my moons gone without hope of retrieval?,0.103,0.88,0.017,-0.8677
"Hi guys,

Since I started crypto, I learned one thing. Marketing is a really big part of the success of a crypto. As you can see, Doge is now always in the top 10 of crypto even if it is the king of the shitcoins!

Now, Safemoon, the 2nd most known shitcoin I think (after Shiba maybe), we all know that this is a shitcoin with no fundamentals. But when you see the subreddit, the discord and the telegram, this is not what we can hear.

Safemoon team aim the newbies and the people who want to be rich, they have a big marketing budget and the do it everywhere in the world ! Even in France the ""influencers"" talk about it and the compare it to the BTC. A lot of newbies will believe that and maybe one day, Safemoon will succeed.

What I am thinking, it will not succeed because I really believe that the founders will rugpull before.

I don't own any safemoon and will never but maybe, with their marketing it will go somewhere! Not to 1$ but maybe higher than now !

My advice : don't invest in safemoon.",0.041,0.885,0.074,0.7891

"Talking with people of the older generation about their youth, one thing became apparent: there was an undeniable optimism. There were the first space explorations, than came the moon landings. It seemed like a time, where technology could solve every problem. 

Some time later came this idea of organic food, paying attention to the land, the animals, ones own body. People were genuinely excited that a better &amp; healthier future was ahead.

Then came around the internet and with it a host of issues. Gaming gained popularity, but with it a focus on micro-payments, psychological tricks to increase addictiveness, etc. Watching from outside, it was obvious the whole market was heading in an unhealthy direction, that wasn't going to change course due to monetary incentives. 

Add the issue of climate change, the lack of commitment to address this, rising totalitarian states, stagnating wages and a whole generation shifted to a more pessimistic outlook. 

I feel like crypto is bringing back optimism to a generation that lost it. It promotes freedom, safety from government despotism, a currency free from political influence, where politicians make short-term decisions to improve their reelection chances. 

It's the first time, we get to hold something truly as our own. 

The rise of crypto is posing a challenge to a highly corrupt traditional banking system. 

DEXes allow for trading without trusting anyone.

DAOs are a unique new form of organisations, where it's possible to channel the forces of a decentralized masses. 

Seeing crypto evolve is absolutely fascinating, from a monetary, political and societal perspective.

"This is the third consecutive month of rising inflation rates. You are now 5.4% poorer than you were a year ago in cash. This will affect the entire world, even though the Euro's inflation rate appears small compared to America's (2.1%).

Keynesianism has given governments the best blank check they would have wanted. Constantly repeating the mantra that government spending is good for the economy. How can it be good to discourage people from saving money and have people chasing highly risky and unstable investments? How can it be good to encourage bureaucracy and expensive, inefficient public programs?

Even though crypto today is largely speculative, I believe it is the last line of defense against government expropriation of wealth. Your crypto cannot be stolen from you unless you are forced or tricked into giving up your private keys. 

Hodl on my friends, as we delve deeper into a recession, there will be more and more resistance against crypto and we will be villified, but you can't stop technological progress!",0.081,0.793,0.126,0.7522
"Thesis: 

A common argument why people don't invest in crypto is that many newcomers and outsiders to the cryptospace is based on price hesitation. The idea is that average investors are discouraged to buy Bitcoin ($32,621 USD as of writing) or ETH ($1959 as of writing) at because the price is too damn high. 

However, BTC is not the most expensive coin. So i decided to look into those more expensive coins. I took the data from www.livecoinwatch.com. There are currently 8 tokens with a higher USD price than Bitcoin. (note, the last 3 keep flipping as they are within a couple hundred dollars of eachother)

I wanted to write this post from a neutral perspective, and not discourage to as this research was meant to be informative content, not financial advice. However after reading some of these whitepapers and not being able to contain my laughter, I must disclose my bias that I wouldn't touch the top 5 priced projects you gave me YOUR money.

I will post the coins in a chart in order from highest price to lowest. Below will be my brief description of the coin, and link the white paper for those interested in reading more about it. 

Numbers have been rounded up to 2 decimals for \*\*aesthetics\*\*

|Name/symbol|Market Cap|24h trading volume|price in USD|price in BTC|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Only 1 Token - O1T| \-  unknown -|$24,483 | **$1666873.89**| 51.14|
|42-coin - 42|$2.9 Million|$2870 |**$71599.27**|2.2  |
|Goes Up Higher - GUH|\- unknown -|$267,683 |**$43557.16** |1.34|
|Unisocks - SOCKS|\- unknown- |$360|**$41915.65**|1.29|

|tBTC - TBTC|$42.5 million|$4270|**$32955.64**|1.01|
|renBTC - RENBTC|$726.8 million|$2.3 million|**$32519.00**|\~ 1|
|Wrapped Bitcoin WBTC|$3.845 B|$167.77 million|**$32491.78**|\~ 1|

O1T- [whitepaper](https://only1token.medium.com/o1t-lightpaper-8729898a392e) ""a single token with 18 decimals, that is shared by each of its holders who are working together to make O1T the single most valuable asset in the world."" This screams ponzi scheme, everyone pooling their money to increase the value of the coin to try to get more people to buy and own something because it's expensive.

42-coin - [no official whitepaper, just a website](https://42-coin.org/). ""42-coin - the answer to storing value"" 42-coin is a scrypt-based cryptocurrency that produces blocks every 42 seconds, which each yield 42 millionths of the total supply. And of course 42-coin's max supply is - you guessed it - 42!""  I'll leave this one to the comments, is 42 the answer to life or cryptoscams? 

GUH - [whitepaper](https://www.guhtoken.org/GuhToken.pdf). ""an elastic supply token that is mathematically guaranteed to increase in price until it exceeds the price of bitcoin"" The name doesn't inspire confidence if you know this [meme reference (youtube link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKXrVriacUM) 

SOCKS - [no whitepaper, no official website, article explaining](https://defiprime.com/unisocks-explained). ""Every SOCKS sold increases the cost of the next, but they can be sold back into the pool at any time."" They exist to make liquidity pools with ETH... i mean there are less risky LPs with much safer market caps that i still wouldn't touch due to impermanent loss.

PieDaoBTC++. No whitepaper, no official website, listed on one exchange: Balancer. Not to slam any of these projects because i haven't researched but if you thought BitcoinGold (BTG), BitcoinSatoshisVision (BSV) or BitcoinCash (BCH) were ripping off the classic BTC name, I would argue this ticker of BTC++ takes the cake. Stay. Away.

tBTC - [whitepaper](https://docs.keep.network/tbtc/index.pdf)  A Bitcoin peg on Ethereum that claims to provide sidechain functionality and scalability extensions. I won't go into why this is useful because i do not have any experience with building projects on the ETH network. Looking forward to someone in the comments who has worked with this or the following two coins with similar functions.

renBTC - [whitepaper](https://renproject.io/litepaper.pdf) a little bigger market cap than the previous token. Its function is to bring BTC, BCH, ZEC to an ETH based app. Claims to ""Transfer any token between any blockchain"" but so far only lists BTC, BCH, ZEC and DOGE to ETH or the BSC. Partners with big names like Binance, [crypto.com](https://crypto.com), coinbase and others.

wBTC - [whitepaper](https://wbtc.network/assets/wrapped-tokens-whitepaper.pdf) Wrapping crypto means exchanging your coins for an ERC-20 token that has a 1:1 value of your asset. You pay for the transaction fee on the network, and the functionality is to create bridges between blockchains. 

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

As you can see, 4/5 the top priced coins don't even have a calculable market cap because we don't know who is holding and we have barely any liquidity on exchanges. 41 dollars of a coin being traded in 24 hours is LAUGHABLE.

It seems the coins with biggest market cap all have ""BTC"" in their name, or are actually associated with the underlying asset like wBTC. Functionality means a lot. I'm not gonna tell you not to shill your coins, but please keep your family and friends away from sus projects. New crypto investors should take price into consideration ONLY after other factors like trading volume, tokenomics, or if listed on trusted exchanges along with other stuff. Do Your Own Research. 

I did not add ATHs intentionally because I want to stress past performance is not indicative of future performance.

Do you have any experience with any of these coins? If i got something wrong about a coin, let me know! Please comment below :) 

  
P.S This is my first post here, tell me how I did!",0.043,0.875,0.081,0.99
"With BTC trading sideways and ALTS one day flying high and the next day retracing, what are you expectations and assumptions for the year end ? 

Do you guys expect the market to behave as such until next year too ? I've been an avid follower of Benjamin Cowen and based on his analysis, he doesn't expect any time soon a catalyst in BTC trends. I somehow take it as a positive thing based on the facts that a longer accumulation phase will burst a better ATH in the long run (which is a WIN for everyone).

Still I got some questions and would love to hear your comments:

\- Do you think BTC will be trading  around the the 30K price range for a while; Do you expect it to go lower; if so why and what price you have in mind ?

\- When do you think the accumulation phase will be over and market stop trading sideways and take a different turn ? Once this is happening; what are your speculation - Are we going down the hill or up ? 

\- Do you think we already have reach the market cycle and top ? Was 64K really the top ?

Let me know your thoughts and speculations ?

One more thing: Any thoughts on ALTS that you HODL and expect to follow the above BTC pattern ?

First time I heard for BTC was back in 2014-2015 and back then I did not fully understood how its going to work and would it have any value (I was 25 years young back then in my defense).

I believed every random reddit post, paper handed, missed to buy/sell on the right point of time, bought some really shitcoins, so crypto newbie textbook.

"For the new moonies

You can only generate moons from posts and comments in this subreddit

Moons come out every 28 days, we are going on the 16th cycle.

You generate them by posting or commenting. Upvotes generate you around .207 ish moon per +vote for the 14th cycle (it changes every cycle), 15th cycle was .304 ish moons per +vote.

As to weight of upvotes comment karma counts twice as much as post karma upvote in relation to per moon received.

Also once you get past your first cycle If you hold the moons you received, you get a 20% bonus for your next cycle (this does not compound and the bonus counts towards what you get each cycle). You also get an extra 5% if you vote in a governance poll during the cycle.

Moons are at its core a form of governance token, anyone can create a poll provided its feasible to execute if passed, your vote is weighed according to the amount of moons earned, bought moons do not count towards one's voting weight.

Moons can also  be used as a tip to show appreciation, or buy special membership to subreddit, this allows you colorful name and badges along with the privilege of posting GIF comments, this costs 1000 moons per month. Part of the moons used to purchase subreddit memberships are burned, and another part of that is redistributed to the pot for the next moon cycle.

There is a total of 250 million Moons, 2.5% are released each cycle. They run on the Rinkby ethereum testnet, gas fees are non existent and since its testnet its also pretty useless. Rumour has it we will move to mainnet or maybe even another blockchain network will house us with cheaper fees (my armchair speculation). Exchange will probably list us in the future at one point. Please look into the outcome of the great reddit bake off (something to do with scaling) for more info on moons moving to mainnet.

They are dropped to your vault, in order to make a vault you must download the reddit official app and create it from there.

Even if you dont have a vault and have commented and received upvotes you can still claim backdated moons, however you must claim your moons within 6 months of them being allocated to you (to do this go to your vault during distribution day), failure to do so will see them being burned, they dont go back to orbit but are burned for good.

If you want to buy moons, Celesti is a straight foward way to buy/sell with XLM or moonswap for BUSD. Ive only used Celesti it was super fast but has a +2% fee. There are other ways to buy/sell using xdai, there are some helpful posts on buying and selling if you look through the search feature, or the main body post of the daily discussion.

Concluding with Opsec. Id recommend you keep your phrase for your vault safe, written down, hidden away, and backed up. That way even if you lose access to your reddit account you can still get your moons back as they may be worth something in the GrimDarkness of the far future.

Is there anything similar in the crypto space, say for tracking top crypto 100 (by marketcap) and buying them in proportion to their marketcap?

I imagine a smart contract where you send your ETH (for simplicity) and it converts it to all these other cryptos (wrapped on ETH for simplicity), updating your holdings once a day. And when you want it back it converts it back to ETH. This is of course very rough and there's a bunch of technical difficulties here to solve but I'd love to invest in something like that.

I started investing in crypto 7 months ago, and all this time, I was using Binance for all I did (and Trust Wallet for the shitcoins and the farming). Now, I am starting to be afraid because of all the FUD about binance everywhere. 

Binance is for me really nice, easy to use, a lot of crypto, easy to stake etc. Very good experience for me ! But now I want to change in a more little exchange and I didn't know which one to choose !

Gemini looks really nice, kucoin too and even kraken (not a lot of cryptos here) but I didn't know how to choose ! Can you tell me your experience about some exchanges and why you recommend it ?

I am investing in BTC ETH ADA and few more coins like ALGO and you know the shilled coins here!

And maybe is it not justified to be afraid about all these FUD about binance and I stay here? And I heard about sites like Celsius or Blockfi to stake BTC etc... Is it a good idea ? Is it secure to let my BTC in websites like this? My ETH are already in BETH so no choice to let them in Binance...

If you put (quality) work into your post, have done your research and the post is useful, people appreciate it. And for your (hard) work, you will be rewarded with Moons. It's automatically encouraging for users to post high quality.

Here is what I came up with for me:

Last Month in June - I received 0.21 Moons.   
I posted one post and put one day in writing it down and another day for correcting, structuring, and refactoring the post. So at least I put 16h work into it. I probably received some upvotes from comments so it's not 100% accurate.  
So to receive a single Moon I would have to put at least \~5x more (quality) work into it: \~80h

This Month July - I received 0.61 Moons.  
Again, some inaccuracy due to comments. I posted a single post and put it with writing and correcting around 1h of (quality) work. Let's say I had 2h because I had to actually work and test the product.  To receive a single Moon I would have to put \~1.7x more (quality) work into it: \~3.4h

"Won’t be a massive post, but I’m personally fascinated by blockchain and just wanted to get a little discussion going! 

So we’re all familiar with crypto here and we make up a small percentage of the world, which in turn represents the tiny fraction of people who know blockchain tech. 

Obviously it can be used financially, crypto is awesome and will bring about some pretty big changes to the financial system, at least I think so anyway. 

But what else can we use blockchain for? It’s still young, but as it’s popularity has increased so has the amount of people that are dedicated to learning about it and using it. 

I’ve read a few different use cases that are really interesting, business logistics is one such aspect where the ability to ledger shipments, dates, products and costs in a transparent way would be incredibly efficient. Other practices include smart contracts, medical logs, and bookkeeping. 

So what effect do we think blockchain will have on the world? Firstly I think crypto will help, as it currently is, to be the front runner by utilising it’s financial benefits! But in regards to logistics and accounting, will blockchain become the logical choice and disrupt big business as we know it? 

We know large corporations ‘sometimes’ do things financially to get ahead, maybe shift some money, evade some tax etc. Would blockchain inhibit the ability for this to happen? Would governments and citizens benefit? 

It’s beyond my brain, but I think shake up is coming for the world eventually, and it’s slowly going to begin with crypto and us as the pioneers, with the other uses of blockchain to follow and continue to disrupt the status quo. 

Just my thoughts! If anyone has any other use cases for blockchain or opinions let me know cause I want to be informed 🙌🙏",0.015,0.825,0.16,0.9949

Since cryptocurrencies emerged, not that long ago, people naturally started to wonder if we were indeed on the verge of a new era, or simply finding new ways to avoid finance controlling and restrain.

Few visionaries saw it as humanity’s natural step to break free of a less violent form of slavery, when over the world we see people being dragged into outrageous mortgages, interest scaling and control of our finances as another way to keep us straight on the path of conformity and “order”.

While bigger interests, bigger causes, good or bad where always far from us, the ordinary people. 

Big fish always eat the small, and we see more interest moving towards submerged economy when drug lords, human trafficking and mafias are on the spotlight. We tend to forget that is also the old guy from somewhere with a wheelbarrow with fruits.

Was this in mind of Satoshi Nakamoto when he invented Bitcoin? A new way of regaining ownership of our money? Of ourselves? I guess we’ll never know. What we do know now is still few have the power, due to misinformation? Lack of trust? Probably only time will tell if we are ready to take it as tool or as a weapon.

"#1. Triple &amp; double tops and bottoms

If the price rebounds from a specific resistance or support level two/three times consecutively, this suggests that the price is about to head in another direction 

e.g: a triple bottom is when the price meets support level 3 times (without breaking under it!) - TA suggests that the price will rise significantly higher the next time it hits that strong support. 

#2. Ascending/descending triangles

Descending triangle - bearish continuation pattern created by drawing a line that connects a series of lower highs and a second horizontal line that connects a series of lows

Ascending triangle - bullish continuation pattern created by drawing a horizontal line at the top high peaks that connects to a diagonal line passing through a series of lows. 

#3. Head and shoulders/inverse

I'm curious how it works. Do you get the same amount of crypto back? Is it in cash form? 

I was thinking I might of found a possible ""free crypto "" loophole with the cashback rewards. 

Say if you bought something with the card so you could get the 4% back in xlm. Once the transaction is finalized (takes a couple days) you get the XLM. You can then immediately transfer that xlm off of coinbase or into whatever coin you want or just cash it out. Once you claim your cashback bonus you then return or refund whatever purchase you made to get your money back while keeping the xlm you just got.

I was wondering if this would actually work or does coinbase somehow ""charge"" you for any cashback rewards if you return/refund a purchase with the card.

"i feel sad for the innocent people who lost their investments to this rug pull.


So I thought why not share what people can do to avoid something like this from happening next time. (MY OPINION NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE)

1. Before you get in any token, you should check how much the top 10-20 holders , if it is more than 20%-25%(excluding the DEFI’s , ex.Pancakeswap, Uniswap or Yearnclassic), it would be risky cause if they dump market will be affected alot. So , for me personally the top  holders should be less than 11-15%.
2. You should also see if the liquidity is locked or not and for how long(usually it should be for 6 months or more than a year), cause majority of the times, it is not locked and dev’s easily pull the liquidity, thus causinh the market to crash and holders not being able to sell.(can be found in the contract, available on Bscscan or Etherscan)
3.  You can also see if the contract ownership has been renounced or not, this means that no further changes can be made to the contract ( some tokens in the past have changed the contract so holder’s can’t sell, thus making the tokens worthless) . However, a drawback of ownership renouncing can be that no more changes could be made for the token in the long term.
4. Most important of all is why is the token here, is it just a pump or dump, meme coin or is it actually here with a utility case. For example, EARNX ,the liquidity is locked, the ownership is renounced and utility case is merging of NFT’s with physical products and using RFID chips. It checks all the boxes. You will find many other tokens that check all the boxes.

To conclude, I would say please do your own research no matter what your friend, or family says. And if possible go through the contract, and holders once .

## How Cryptocurrency work?

Cryptocurrency is one of the most popular usage of blockchain technology.  This distributed technology works on the algorithm of creating new blocks connected with the existing ones through Hashing. The members in the P2P network have to accept the block by participating as miners. Moreover, there are many consensus like proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, delegated proof-of-stake, proof-of-authority.

Cryptocurrency is issued every time on creation of a new block. It is used as a reward for participants taking part in the consensus process. Besides that, the process involves allocating participant’s resources to support transparency of[ blockchain](https://www.naapbooks.com/blockchain-technology-and-how-governments-can-benefit-from-them/).

"The Ethereum network is taking a big step towards a scalable PoS blockchain. This is how the London and Berlin hard forks fit into the path to Ethereum 2.0.

Ethereum ( ETH ) has been on a hot streak so far in 2021, with its value rising from about $ 1,300 at the beginning of the year to nearly $ 4,000 in May. However, Ethereum price aside, the ongoing problems on the Ethereum blockchain have brought to light the anger of traders and decentralized application (DApp) developers in the Ethereum ecosystem. L **to lack of scalability and high rates of gas are the main problems.**

As one of the largest cryptocurrency platforms for decentralized applications, Ethereum has been dealing with network congestion reflecting the high gas fees that people have had to pay with each transaction. Since the beginning of the year, at times, **the cost of facilitating transactions in the Ethereum ecosystem has hovered around the range of $ 16-20, reaching $ 100 in DApps such as Uniswap that have a high volume of transactions.**

From this point of view, **the transition to Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2) as a solution designed to address scalability issues, as well as solve the problem of skyrocketing gas rates, is a welcome respite from the Ethereum community.**

Eth2, or Serenity, will be a technical update that will move the Ethereum blockchain from a proof-of-work (PoW) protocol to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. , thus increasing its transaction capacity, **reducing gas rates, and making the network easy to scale and greener when generating new currencies and validating transactions.**

After years of preparation, the step towards Eth2 began with the launch of the Beacon Chain as the first step to revolutionize the Ethereum network. **The move to a PoS blockchain will be one of the biggest upgrades in the life of the Ethereum blockchain, and will therefore take place in phases. London's Ethereum hard fork is one of the updates that will bring the Ethereum network closer to Serenity.**

## Berlin's hard fork

The Berlin upgrade went live on block 12,244,000 on April 15. Named after the host city of Ethereum Devcon's inaugural convention, Berlin is a precursor to the larger London hard fork, incorporating four Ethereum Enhancement Proposals (EIPs) that address gas prices and allow new types of transactions.

Berlin's EIP-2565 consists of the reduction of gas rates on Ethereum. **This mechanism uses a feature called Modular Exponentiation (ModExp) to benefit Ethereum users who need to run services on the Ethereum network.**

**The EIP0-2718 protocol makes all types of transactions backward compatible, thus facilitating the incorporation of new transaction logic in Ethereum.** The developers who created this protocol used a new feature known as the Typed Transaction Envelope.

The Berlin hard fork also introduces a proposal titled EIP-2929, which introduces a gas price increase in opcode transactions. In computing, opcodes are parts of a machine language that specify operations. Ethereum opcodes have been a major pain point for denial of service (DoS) attacks in the past. **With EIP-2929, a higher gas cost will eliminate the incentive for denial of service attacks.**

Finally, **the Berlin hard fork includes the EIP-2930 protocol, which is based on the EIP-2718, and which provides a new type of transaction mechanism that allows users to form lists of wallet addresses to be able to trade with fees. much lower gas rates.**

## Reactions to Berlin

The EIPs introduced with the Berlin hard fork were intended to reduce the cost of gas rates at a time when network saturation was at its peak, as well as improve the efficiency of Ethereum. However, **the update was postponed several times due to concerns about potential vulnerabilities caused by the centralization of the update.**

Furthermore, the consensus in the Ethereum community was that Berlin would have less of an impact in the short term, but that it would pave the way for the long-awaited London hard fork EIP-1559 protocol.

## London's hard fork: increased elasticity of blocks

Ethereum's London hard fork is part of Ethereum's roadmap on its way to the Eth2 launch. **The long-awaited hard fork will likely launch on August 4 in a delayed and previously rescheduled release for late July.**

The Ethereum London hard fork will include five Ethereum enhancement protocols. **The most notable of the five EIPs are the EIP-1559 and the EIP-3554.**

**EIP-1559 introduces a new fee structure that will make Ethereum deflationary.** Although highly controversial, this protocol change aims to burn part of the commissions generated on the Ethereum blockchain, thus reducing the income of miners.

**EIP-3554, on the other hand, will introduce incremental difficulty in mining Ethereum, thus removing the incentive for miners to participate in the PoW network.** This move is expected to push miners towards the new PoS blockchain while freezing the proof-of-work network.

## Ethereum miners react to EIP-1559

**While Ethereum users and investors anticipate the launch of EIP-1559 as it will help reduce gas rates, Ether miners were not enthusiastic about the proposal.**

The long-awaited update will put Ethereum on a deflationary path through the burning of commissions that originally went to miners. The EIP-1559 plans to set a flat fee for everyone on the Ethereum network, so that no one will have the option to pay more to have their transaction confirmed faster than other transactions. **The network sets the commission automatically, and then the commission is collected from transactions and burned, allowing a dynamic expansion and contraction of the size of the blocks.**

For users who wish to prioritize their transactions, **this EIP-1559 update will include an optional ""priority rate"" that will act more like a tip that incentivizes the miner to prioritize the transaction. Miners will be able to pocket this priority commission, however, the base commission will be burned.**

According to James Beck, director of communications for ConsenSys - the technology company that supports the Ethereum blockchain - **the burning of the base commission will put deflationary pressure on the emission of ETH.**

**While some argue that the deflationary mechanism of this update will lead to an Ether price boom and create a positive price feedback loop, some of the disgruntled miners have criticized the move as it will reduce their revenue significantly.**

In protest at the upcoming implementations, some Ethereum miners expressed their desire to carry out a 51-hour show of force on the Ethereum network, directing computational resources to a group that supports unilateral changes to the Ethereum network. Since then, the threats have subsided, and Vitalik Buterin has proposed a quick transition to Eth2 as a solution.

## The near future of hard forks in Ethereum

**The London and Berlin hard forks are just the beginning of the improvement proposals coming to Ethereum before the network's transition to Eth2.** Following the London fork, the Ethereum community will prepare for the Shanghai fork, which is scheduled to go live by the end of the year.

The Shanghai hard fork will be the last step in the journey towards merging Eth1 with Eth2. **The discussions underway among developers on the hard branch Shanghai suggest that the update will take place in October 2021 and implemented exclusively a merger rather than an added feature to the next Eth2, as has been the case of hard bifurcations previously.**

Overall, there is a mix of excitement and disappointment in the Ethereum community, **with some anticipating a move to a PoS blockchain that will result in cheaper transaction costs, while others lament a reduction in profits.** It remains to be seen if the updates will lead to a quick and successful transition to Ethereum 2.0.",0.069,0.863,0.068,0.9404

I am a 26-Y/o beginner in this crypto world, some of you can relate to the fact that investing or understanding crypto is not everyone's cup of tea. I tried to follow the influential people and still lost a lot of money in this. I tried to gain knowledge as much as possible yet the outcomes were the same.

At that stage, it is quite obvious to leave it aside. Especially when there is so much to choose from can result in a terrible decision.

Gradually I came to know about coreto and here I join the [CORETO](https://coreto.io/) community and actively participate in various conversations. From there I invested in Coreto and I would not say within a week I got lucky. But gradually I observe that I'm on the good side.

This much is obvious. Holier than Swiss on Rye, creamier than Monterrey Jack, sharper than a well aged Cheddar. We learned as much as children but have been blinded by ""NASA"" and ""Science"" trying to distract us from the truth, much like big banks try to stop crypto's efforts. 

Where does this leave Reddit Moons? Are we unknowingly perpetuating this myth? Fighting amongst ourselves... Upvoting, downvoting, memeing... All for cheese?

"**This is a comprehensive list of graphs about the Round 15 distribution. For a concise TL;DR version, head over to the end of this post.**

# MOONs per karma :

[MOONs per Karma point](https://preview.redd.it/t0xddjoc5bb71.png?width=1167&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cff2c14f818668d808f4fa9b8fb96409d19bfe04)

There's a 48% Increase compared to round 14. I guess people run out of excitement when crypto isn't making new ATHs.

# Number of Vaults :

[Number of vaults per round](https://preview.redd.it/4li1s5lp5bb71.png?width=1173&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d39824f95e42ebf828dceb0a8061870861ef49e)

There's a weird 17% decrease compared to round 14. Maybe people stopped posting more or people left the sub or banned? This is the first round where number of vaults dipped

# Average MOONs users earned :

[People be getting MOONs](https://preview.redd.it/yhsy8k606bb71.png?width=1377&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8504ee8a8ff32f9798dcc97d17f519054ea0bdeb)

This perfectly lines up with the decrease in number of vaults. This round, contributors earned 64% more on average compared to round 14. I think many people stopped being active in the sub, so existing and still active users are earning more.

# Average MOONs moderators earned :

&amp;#x200B;

[Sadly mods are earning less on average this time](https://preview.redd.it/vigjbpn76bb71.png?width=1401&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eca27776ec4c26f580842a5f849865f44b02ac0f)

Well, moderators too are earning less moons. There is almost a 20% decrease compared to round 14.

# MOON bags distribution :

All levels of moon ranges have an increased number of people. More users have plowed their way into the &gt;1000 group. **There's a staggering 18629 people without addresses listed in the distribution.** **NEWCOMERS PLEASE SETUP YOUR VAULTS!**

"I have been going back thru my transactions trying to figure out why my record keeping and crypto.com's history are off by almost $1k .
I went thru the transaction history list and then looked at the screenshots I take of each transaction as well as the emails received after each transaction and compared all three to eachother. 
My findings show that for all BTC transactions all three sets of numbers match. However I've found that for all of my  alt/meme coins and tokens transactions, my screenshot of confirmation, the crypto.com transactions log and the email don't match, as well as not matching eachother either.  This happens on both the purchase and sell.  For example, every time (around 20 times)  I sold 100million shib the number shown for price on the sell screen when initiating sell and the price shown on the 10sec  timed confirm screen is less by double digits.  Sell screen shows the  dollar amount and coin price of 0.00000822 when clicking sell,  then the 10sec for stated price confirm screen shows a different dollar amount the sell will generate and price of 0.00000745. After clicking confirm yes the email that follows shows a lower dollar amount and sell price of 0.00000711. I get that the prices fluctuate rapidly but that's the entire reason behind the 10second confirm screen.  Maybe it's just me not understanding something but it seems kinda shady when the price shown on the 10sec screen that I'm confirming to complete transaction @ that specific price ends up going thru with a lower amount than what was confirmed @... I know that at these amounts of decimal places into the millionths the numbers don't make a big difference and usually only equates to approximately a dollar or three, but after my hundreds of transactions it's accumulated to right @ $1k difference in what I should have based off the numbers in the confirm @ this price step and the what it actually purchased or sold at price was. I also find it shady that these discrepancies are not in my favor even once, and the actual sell @ prices are less than confirmed number and the actual buy @ prices are higher than what they were confirmed for.

"Seeing as Uniswap has launched their alpha on Optimism, I decided to give it a try earlier today and figured I'd share my experiences. And share how it works, in case someone else wants to give it a go.

First, I had to add Optimism to Metamask, much like you'd do with Polygon. There's a guide to do that [here](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5404230-how-to-connect-to-optimism).

I used the [Optimism Gateway](https://gateway.optimism.io/) to send a small bundle of eth from my wallet over to the Optimism layer 2. This was a fairly expensive smart contract transaction on the Etherium side, costing about $16.94 in gas fees. After waiting a few minutes, my transferred eth was showing up in Metamask on Optimism.

I then went to uniswap.org and well, it worked pretty much as usual. Right now transaction fees for a swap are a bit under $1, so about a tenth of the cost on Ethereum. Transactions are instant, however, unlike Ethereum.

The fees go up and down with the fees on the main Ethereum network- they're used to pay the gas cost of publishing transaction data back to the Ethereum, since Optimism is a true Layer 2.",0.006,0.808,0.186,0.9889

“Thanks for reaching out. It is true. Harmony is also faster than Nano in our practical tests. However, the delay considers the number of confirmations after which funds are considered final.

This number of confirmations can be anything, the more the better. So we take Binance confirmation counts as the metric for all the listed coins to make sure it is as objective as possible.

In Harmony's case this number of confirmations is 25. So hence the longer time for the transaction to be fully finalised.”


So, i’ve got a couple questions. 

Why do they use Binance confirmation counts as metric in your opinion? 
Also, which is the reason why i posted all this here, do you guys find some discrepancy between the real data and the one provided by this site on the cryptos you have researched and invested? Thanks in advance for your time.",0.023,0.841,0.136,0.9801

"Some people seem to believe that, but I am still skeptical. For sure crypto is here to stay and the technology will make sure crypto has a big place in our society in the future, but I highly doubt crypto will ever completely replace FIAT. A lot of business will add crypto as a payment option, but they won't ever not accept FIAT in favor of crypto. The vast majority of people earn their money in FIAT, and thus the majority of their savings are all in FIAT, which makes it unlikely that crypto will ever replace FIAT for making everyday purchases. For most people, who currently don't have any crypto, they'd have to exchange their FIAT for USDC or some other crypto and then most likely pay a fee to pay in crypto. Why would you pay the extra fees for something like groceries if you could just pay directly in FIAT and save money?  As long as people earn their salaries in FIAT, crypto won't ever competely replace FIAT. Though it could work as an international currency, where wherever you go you can you crypto for payments instead of converting to foreign currencies all the time, as long as the conversion fee for crypto is lower. Obviously crypto certainly has a lot of other uses, but I highly doubt it will ever replace FIAT.",0.079,0.833,0.088,0.6671

7 of the top 20 coins from 2017 are still in the top 20 today

&amp;#x200B;

That number doesn't sound bad right? well.. let's look at the rankings of the cryptos that aren't in the top 20 today.

&amp;#x200B;

Monero: #27. Pretty good!

DASH: #65. That kinda hurts. From 7th to 65th for such a fine coin.

Augur: #141. Oh boy. poor augur.

MaidSafeCoin: #124. Their whitepaper makes a prediction about the year 2017 as the future. OOF

Steem: #167. Its ATH was $8 in 2018. The peak during the 2021 bull run was $1.25.

Nem: #70. Maybe one day it will hit $1 again. 

Iconomi: Unknown rank. It went from $5.5 to $0.21. The peak during the current bull was $0.30. I'm sorry for anyone who put money into this.

factom: #763. $62 to $1. Getting closer to ICP type investments.

Waves: #59. Waves is actually doing pretty well and even if you bought in at the peak of the 2017 bull, if you sold at the 2021 bull, you would double your money!

DigixDao: #500. Despite collapsing in ranking the price hasn't shown to care actually.

Zcash: #63. The opposite of digixdao, despite staying near top 100, the price struggles.

Lisk: #116. ATH of $33... $2.50 today. $9 in may.

Gamecredits: #704. Probably the most likely coin i'd see collapse just from the name itself. $6 ATH 2018 to $0.40 during the 2021 bull market.

" I personally find Moons to lack any great use cases.


Use cases from best to worse:


**-You can vote on community proposals with a vote per moon earned that you still own.**


 This would be a great use case if it related to buying moons but u less you have a reddit account that has previously earned moons you can not buy moons to gain votes. It's great to have a self governing system but DAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations, have existed and there are some that govern more important matters and some that function with much less complexity.


**-You can hold onto the particular moons you've earned for the duration of a moon distribution cycle to earn 20% bonus on your karma for the next distribution.**


This method of earning additional moons is fine but it's not a reason to buy moons nor does it punish selling or tipping as much as everyone seems to think it does. It's important that everyone understands that you don't have to never sell to always recieve the bonus.



**-You can tip them. **


A standard aspect of cryptocurrency, and even here Moons unfortunately will require Ether (Ethereum) to transfer oncemain net and this may be a high fee for a while. Nothing great here...


-You can over pay for special membership by burning 1000 moons instead of buying membership.


We all know the situation about using them to buy membership, the mods can't fix it and it's not an issue as much as it's just not a great feature. Note: Buying membership burns 1000 moon even if you just use fiat money.



Basically, Moons could really use another use case and it's up to the Reddit developers. If Reddit does not do anything I expect Moons to lose value.


Speculation for moons has already reigned in the price to 9 cents a coin. People assume reddit will continue to support the coin with more features and the r/cc will someday adopt the coin to the point that  most users who are subscribed to the subreddit will own Moons.

"This often quoted phrase is from the 70's and is in reference to scientific models.

NOTE: I'm not talking to you day-traders, you folks do whatever you do, I'm talking to the average Joe retail crypto investor.

Economics, stocks, crypto are even more difficult to use models with because unlike many scientific experiments, it's difficult to reproduce and/or isolate specific variables that have fairly large weights to a system.

Events like bitcoin halvening are easily recognized, predictable, etc. This is very well know to heavily impact the market. Bitcoin dominance as well. 

Geopolitical, global economic crises or events, specific country's economic or tax policies, etc. fall into a different bucket of more murky, and difficult to predict impact on.

If a market were perfectly predictable, it would no longer be predictable because it would then cause buying and selling pressure as a result of that knowledge.

No one knows what the price will be a month from now, a year from now, or ten years from now. 

If you think crypto will go up over 5-10 years and like it? Invest. If you think it will go down? You're probably in the wrong subreddit.

Anyone telling you that bitcoin will go to 10k based on some model? Well, Elon just tweeted or somehow Satoshi dumps his wallet. Maybe the temperature rises in some area causing collapse of some commodity market. That model? Useless.

Invest in what you believe in, don't go all in because someone said the price will hit something. They don't know. They can't know. The only certainty are things like halvenings, tax policies being weird, and that cardano will have smart contracts by 2070.

"Im unsure of what this community thinks of Monero, but I dont really understand why there is no love for XMR in the crypto space.

So many coins are shilled and popular right now which compete with giants like BTC and ETH - Monero however is a privacy coin with its own unique usecase and is allready best at it - and I am absolutely sure with the success of blockchain technology there will be a crucial need for privacy coins like it.

The concept of a privacy coin like XMR brings the risk of a potential hidden inflation bug - thats why this level of privacy is not acceptable for a main store of value. So I dont think an update on any other larger platform will ever make Monero absolete. But the project is old enough that even such a bug can be considered highly unlikely.

And it also has a great community! Many people mine XMR on their idle CPUs without profit or even at a loss - just to support the network. Miners like xmrig are available precompiled for all operating systems, you can even mine it on the recent apple arm or raspberry pis! This is unique among crypto and reminds me more of the people operating tor nodes with no financial interest.

I want to bring you on a journey of many moons.    As many moons as you can get.

Be grateful for the moons you are about to receive in a few days.  I know I am.

This is the most exciting part of the month.  Knowing in a few days your moons are coming.    Like a crypto welfare check. 

It's not enough to make you rich but it's enough to go food shopping. Even for people in the US.  So it's really similar to a welfare check.  

That's great because usually you had to be poor to qualify.   All you had to do was complain to the state that you are poor. 

All you have to do here is complain on posts... 
That you're poor.   

But at least they can go up.  If you Hodl your welfare check , it's going to lose its value by deflation.  If you Hold moons, you can get rich.

Some people might even be able to afford a buy out in their own government in some of these countries. $10,000 bribe should do the trick.  That's what 2000 moons when we hit main net?


It will get to about $2 to $3.

"In the context of crypto trading, rekt refers to financial ruin – suffering a heavy financial loss from a coin or token that has dropped significantly in its value, caused by a bad trade or investment.

 

You might say that a crypto investor got “rekt” when he/she is losing big time with a trade, for example, selling their bitcoin right before the price skyrocketed. The term can also refer to the cryptocurrency itself that nosedived in price, or a market that dropped significantly, e.g. “the market is rekt.” 

Tired of Getting ‘Rekt’
The term is usually used among the online gaming community describing a player (or team) that was defeated in an embarrassing or silly way. In the crypto community, rekt often refers to margin traders that have a liquidation for making a bad trade. 

For example, Alice is trading on margin and opens big leverage on a long position. If the market goes down and she gets liquidated, we may say “Alice got rekt.”

In some cases, being “rekt” does not mean truly losing money, since “rekt” assets can still bounce back.",0.145,0.82,0.036,-0.9733

"I got my intro to crypto in late 2017 buying a little bit of ETH and a bunch of shitcoins. When shit hit the fan and the bubble burst I never sold because it wasn't enough money for me to me freaking out about ""losing"". Like a like a lot of people do in their first cycle I lost interest and forgot about crypto until 2020.

I will not make that mistake again. I was stacking little bits of ETH along the way in 2020 but made an unfortunately timed decision to buy my largest portion at of ETH at 4k after selling some stocks. I am now studying a FinTech course (Python, ML and Solidity) and aspiring to become a blockchain developer and am really in it for the long haul.

I just want to say, for anyone who this is their first crypto rodeo, if you like Ethereum, Bitcoin or any other crypto for that matter, even if you don't whole heartedly believe in it yet and your just trying to make money... Don't forget about crypto in times like these. Keep researching and learning, Ethereum is the future of finance among other things. It may go down for a little while, the excitement will fade, but this is only temporary.

I wish so so much that I hadn't lost interest. My AVG buy price for ETH would be somewhere around $100 instead of 4k. Don't be me when the next bull run comes and have missed out on the 40x.

"So, I cruise the new section of this subreddit frequently and sometimes I see people ask about new coins (that are outside of the top 50 mostly). These people want to know, where should I park my money? What about this new coin that has a dog on it, should I buy that? 

Most of us that have been around for a while, we tell these people hey don't buy the coin with the boobs on it or the dog on it! That coin is dumb!!! 

I mean 99% of the time I feel that's a safe opinion to have. Most dev teams that make coins with sex parts or Elon or Safe or Dogs in the name just want to steal people's money. 

Still I feel (controversially) that is a bad opinion for this community to parrot. Cuz if you just say the consensus over and over again you're not truly evaluating anything. You're just giving acceptable answers and because of the nature of this subreddit you're going to be compensated for the answer with the most buzzwords in it. 

So! How can you, as a new crypto investor, exercise your critical thinking muscles and find a rewarding project? 

Jackson Palmer seems to firmly believe that crypto is about taking advantage of others. If you're confused as to what I'm referring to, just search this subreddit and go find the news article about his tweets and read it. Many people have posted something about this because posting news articles is super economical (and writing a multi-paragraph guide is not, re:I'm a little bit dumb)

The problem is that he's a little bit right in that, there's a lot of assholes out there that just want to steal the fuck out of every dime you have. That can't be emphasized enough. So, how do you tell if someone is out to swindle you out of your dollars or if they have other goals? 

Ok so here's where I trigger all my fellow leftists: making money isn't inherently bad. Right now, the system in place means that money is equal to life. I feel like anyone still reading this book of a Reddit post is exactly like me, meaning if someone gifted you 10k dollars that would be life changing. 10k dollars is basically like 10 dollars to someone like Elon Musk. Moving on. If you, as a poor person, investing 10 dollars in dogecoin and having that turn into 1000 dollars is fucking amazing. You earned 990 dollars with zero back breaking or mentally taxing (or both at the same time!) labor. It feels fucking luxurious am I right? Isn't that why we're all here now? (I am a little bit honestly) 

The problem being that if you bought dogecoin and made 990 dollars, odds are you're just profiting off the gullibility of your sad loser comrades and your greater luck of hearing about dogecoin first. 

So it's good in the sense that you avoided shitty slave labor wages, bad in the sense that other comrades had to lose. 

Idk I'm not the best investor. Being an ""evil"" investor isn't bad tho! Any time you get to opt out of the shitty work system is a gain. But I make a lot of emotional choices. So! How do you win at crypto? 

You pick projects that are community beneficial. And unlike Jackson Palmer, I believe they are out there. 

Dogecoin is definitely not one of them! There's no features that benefit late adopters or small holders. It's a matter of getting in early and selling at the right time. No wonder he's so angry! He sold at the wrong time and missed out by a whole lot!! 

Eth and BTC are in a different category. There's developers working on these coins and making them better. I trust my money in ETH and BTC cuz of, well it's mutual benefit. My money makes ETH and BTC worth more. The dev teams of these coins hold the coin itself, so when I want to buy it I pay them for their work. In turn,   they work to attract more investors. Therefore, earning me more money because my principal investment is worth more. 

Idk market forces mean that sometimes I'll buy in at the wrong time. However I am confident in these coins ability to win out over the long run. Theres a great many people, developers and otherwise, that are heavily invested in these two, and it's like chaining my very small rowboat to a big barge. If they sink I sink. I feel like I can trust them because I think their mission is solid, their skills are elite, and their transparent with their actions

So what does that mean for the shitcoin you want to buy? Is the dev team as good as all the people working on Ethereum or Bitcoin? Or even other altcoins I won't mention because I don't want to shill so hard here? 

TLDR: Transparency. Community involvement. Community sponsored decision making. Privacy. Tokenomics that aren't inherently predatory (like taxes on selling). A dev team that listens to and encourages criticism. These are things that make a crypto not a hyper-capitalist nightmare",0.087,0.782,0.131,0.9929
"I know many people buy additional device for back up in case one is lost or destroyed but another scenario is for your spouse.  I purchased a nano x for myself and one for my wife. They both, of course, share the same seed but I let her set a different pin on the second device that she would remember. I showed her the basics, had her set up her own Coinbase account and how she would need to transfer money should something happened to me.  This is much better than trying to figure out how to leave instructions on how to access my accounts. In my opinion, it’s like both of us having keys to a joint account where most of the money came from anyway lol. But instead of having to leave instructions on how to access my device, she has her own.  

I know a lot of times our spouses and significant others are not “crypto-savvy” but I encourage you to educate them with at least the basics so they are able to at least access funds in the event they lose you.

"Realizing that the future for cryptos will have little to do with currencies and everything to do with platforms, Bitcoin is upgrading to have functioning smart contracts (Bitcoin actually already had this technology and the first NFTs were on it, but it wasn’t very useful).

To explain, the way that platforms work is through “smart contracts,” which are just “if … then” instructions. Since computer programs are just “if … then” instructions (for the most part), having smart contracts = having the ability to host other programs.

Bitcoin’s upgrade is the Taproot Upgrade and it's already in its testing phase. It will be fully deployed in November.

When this is complete, it’ll transform from a cryptocurrency to a cryptoplatform. Then its main problems will be (1) developing apps that (2) people use.

To get people to use it, Bitcoin will have to be fast. It’s slower than Ethereum, and Ethereum is too slow already. So, that’s where it’ll need to focus.

If Bitcoin can’t manage that, then it’ll probably still continue as a proven store of value as a basic financial anchor layer.",0.018,0.9,0.082,0.9115

"Here’s a Sun post instead:

The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth; it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.

The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As such, it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a][14][22] years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.

The Sun's core fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 million tons of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable – but not for about five billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.

The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric times. The Sun was thought of by some cultures as a deity. The synodic rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of solar calendars, one of which is the Gregorian calendar, the predominant calendar in use today.

"First off I just wanna say I’m somewhat new to crypto, my story started by getting paid in a video game through crypto. I got paid in a stable coin (USDT). My question for you vets is how would one pay another person in non stable coins… ie ETH, BTC etc. These coins are very unstable and move like Wildfire. Up $200, down $500, up $800 all within days. 



Is crypto only being utilized as a tool of payment into a stable value, ie ETH into the US dollar for payment. Are people trading goods for ETH? 



I’m only using ETH as an example*",0.037,0.861,0.102,0.7436
"I’m new to the crypto world and have a question about altcoins. 

What are the risks to throwing small amounts of cash into a bunch of altcoins? I was just wondering the downstream consequences if any.

"Let’s do the math. The adult population of the US is 209.1million. 17% of that is 35.5million.

&amp;#x200B;

Now consider the phrase, “Not your keys, not your crypto.” While 35.5m people claim to own crypto, how many of those people actually own the keys to their crypto?

&amp;#x200B;

Now let us take a look at the total number of wallets which hold crypto. There are a total of 38.2m BTC wallets holding BTC, 3.2m wallets holding Tether on the Ethereum Network, and 2.4m wallets holding Safemoon on the BSC network. If it is true that 35.5m Americans are holding crypto, where are they holding it? It is very unlikely that 35.5m Americans own that many BTC wallets when there are only 38.2m BTC wallets holding BTC on the planet.

&amp;#x200B;

From the numbers, you must conclude that if 35.5m Americans are holding crypto, the majority are holding their crypto on centralized exchanges. And on some exchanges like Robinhood, users are unable to withdraw their crypto. So not only do they lack the keys for their crypto, they lack the ability to obtain the keys for their crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

So do these people really own crypto? On paper they own crypto, but the asset they own has none of the technological benefits of crypto. It is not decentralized, it is not peer-to-peer, it is not censorship resistant, and if the exchanges decide to exit scam, these crypto owners would be left with nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of measuring crypto adoption through the metric of unique wallet addresses, most of which are empty. Or the number users on centralized exchanges. The metric that should be used to measure crypto adoption is crypto users who hold the keys to their crypto. Because that is the number that really matters. That is the number of people who are able to challenge the fiat system.",0.032,0.903,0.065,0.6834

I will keep DCA’ing into my favorite coins each week and await any moons that may be bestowed on me each month.

"

With another distribution coming in i thought it would be nice to try and clarify a bit on how to trade your moons, be ir for Fiat be it for other cryptos. I have to remember y’all too that if you can you should keep the moons on your vault as that would make you eligible for the 20% bonus for holding for the next distribution.
Okay, but how do you actually sell them? There’s a few options out there, the first one is using Kuyumcu (just google it) but I might warn you that the conversion fees are quite high, 20-30%. To use kuyumcu you have to make a nano wallet, To do that use Natrium (available on smartphones), then you’ll have to go to kuyumcu (https://moon.nano.trade) and trade your moons for some Nano, after that it’s as simple as transferring the Nano to a reputable exchange, ( Kraken accept nano deposits if I’m not mistaken) then you do your thing there, sell it for fiat or trade for other cryptos. 


Another option is using Celesti.trade, I have  used it and it’s fast and the fees are waaay lower than kuyumcu’s, so it might be the better option. The steps are quite similar but instead of making a Nano wallet you’ll have to make a Lumens wallet or you can receive it directly into your exchange if they accept lumens deposits.

The last option is using xDai but I’m yet to go that route so I’ll just leave a link to another redditors post regarding that.

Not everything is FUD - some news is just bad fucking news. Every asset class has its downsides and living in denial about those issues won’t make them go away. Really, we should all try to learn the problems with crypto so we can be better understand and argue in its favor.

Things like ransomware, government intervention, proposed tax hikes, gas fees, etc. are examples of genuinely bad news - no matter that’s your favorite YouTuber says or how they try to explain it away.

“TO THE MOON” culture inspires lots of optimism for people and that’s fine, but it denies the reality that things can actually go wrong in a major way. It’s why the crash in may was so shocking.

Be optimistic about crypto, but don’t be blindly optimistic. Learn the issues alongside the strengths. Don’t be a moron living in denial of what could go wrong with your favorite coin or the market overall.

"Last month I thought to start adding payment options for a few major coins I hold. Easy right?   
Just list the public addresses at the bottom of invoices along side your bank account number and people can pay how they like. Then I thought for five minutes longer and realized it's not quite that simple...   


Firstly, I would need clients to provide a screenshot or proof of the exact time they made the transaction, so I could be sure that they indeed paid the right amount to the cent, as even 30 seconds later that amount could be worth less/more.   


I would probably have to eat the fees myself, I think that's fair enough, except depending on their method of payment (wallet, exchange etc) the fees would be different each time. 

&amp;#x200B;

To enter the payment into my accounting software, I would need to manually create custom payments, which would not actually be in my bank account that is linked to the software, thereby creating extra hassle and work.   
I decided it'd be easier for me and my accountant, if I just payed their bills with my own fiat once the crypto comes in, so nothing would change book wise.   


Then I realised, it's basically just forced crypto investing for me, which is fine. But crypto is so volatile, why would I have it like this when I could just get paid in fiat, and then be free to convert that into crypto much more sensibly by timing the purchases as any logical buyer should do. 

I gave my accountant a call (this was in March), to ask his opinions and also just get some general feedback on what was going to happend when we met for the yearly chat and I would be disclosing my holdings from that year. It was the first time I had mentioned crypto to him. I could feel his mood sink through the phone lol. He informed me that on his desk was a huge document issued from inland revenue just that week, that he was expected to learn and understand, that was purely about how to go about accounting for crypto purchases/sales and holdings for his clients. He said I was the third person that week to enquire about their crypto. This is a chartered accountant with 30 years experience, at their busiest time of the year, trying to get his head around something that is completely foreign to him. I asked if they'd like to forget I ever asked, and maybe we can sort it out one day when/if I finally cash out, and they were pretty keen to just take that route. 

But it got me thinking, really what is the advantage to accepting crypto as payment, apart from the obvious perks of advertising and enforcing public knowledge of something we believe in.   
I saw posts on here recently about how business who started accepting crypto got a large bump in customers/sales due to it. Is this really true? Does anyone really want to use their holdings to pay for things when the market is slumped massively compared to where it was a couple of months ago? 

And for anyone accepting crypto successfully, and easily, how are you going about it?

"The recent partnerships emerging between Crypto.com and various sporting entities (Formula 1, UFC, NHL team Montreal Canadiens, Aston Martin F1 Team) has got me thinking. While it is obvious that these sports are global sports that attract millions of viewers and therefore create exposure to the general public, something I have been thinking about recently is that these partnerships may also have a secondary knock-on affect to the sports betting sector. 

The global sports betting sector shows to have been worth approximately 200 billion US dollars in 2020 alone. Obviously I don't expect these few partnerships to create waves immediately, but it could certainly begin to tap into this steady stream of fiat as time progresses and exposure increases. 

Anecdotally, prior to entering crypto a couple of months ago, I used to bet frequently on the Formula 1 and various other sports  (this is before the Formula 1 partnership was announced though). A friend introduced me to crypto by telling me that he had put a few hundred dollars on some alt coin and doubled his money. This piqued my interest as someone who was not averse to risk taking when it comes to fiat, having likely lost more fiat to gambling than I have made over the years. 

I had never really looked into crypto before because, surprise surprise, the media/investment firms/banks had always painted it as being a con, a scam, and so forth, so I never really bothered to take a look. As soon as I started to look into crypto it became glaringly obvious that crypto was far beyond what it was generally painted to be and I have been diving into the rabbit hole ever since. 

What I haven't been doing since getting into crypto is gambling. Not once. And I don't intend to put another dollar into gambling because crypto satisfies the dopamine reward hit that gambling used to give me, only I expect to make money in the long term with crypto rather than lose it as I did with gambling. 

So, I'm curious. Are there any other gamblers out there who have gravitated towards crypto and left gambling behind/reduced their fiat allocation to gambling? Is it likely that we could see these partnerships begin to take the sports betting sector's precious fiat away from them, which would introduce a steady stream of investment into crypto from this sector year on year?

The last (or current if you believe that we are merely taking a break) bull run had a few phases, one of which was the NFT phase. NFT was actually happening before all the excitement at the beginning of the year. 

I am a true believe that history ALWAYS repeats itself. It might not be a carbon copy but it gives very good indications. Based on this theory, we will repeat an start again with the NFT phase.

Just want to start by saying MUCH WOW! 
what an awesome community; completely in love with crypto, the people developing the technology and the community surrounding it.
I started GPU mining in January and put some of my profits into Doge. Was lucky enough to cash out enough to buy 2 HNT miners (Bobcat 300) that are on their way.
I've also invested in a 5700XT (for games and mining when its not in use).
I've recently starting using a visa from crypto.com which is super awesome and makes crypto a lot more useable in day to day life.
It's been really amazing getting into this, doing a little day trading for fun with like...tiny amounts of doge to learn, seeing BTC balances build while GPU mining, anticipating my IOT devices.
Seriously an amazing space.
My friends are starting to get into it as well, we're kinda working together on the IOT devices and it's just awesome.
Feeling the love, seeing the results and looking forward to where this can go! 
Honestly a huge change.
I'm a pretty dedicated FIRE EFT guy; for me, crypto is a closed financial system separate from my regular income etc.

"I get very concerned when people talk about how “if coin X reaches price Y then I’ll be rich” and call that investing. Let’s call what it really is folks: gambling.

That being said if anyone were to do their due diligence on Shiba it would look something like this:

1. Monetary policy: burn 50% of the total supply (1 quadrillion) to Vitalik Buterin which has been done already. Now why 1 quadrillion? Many other tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, even Cardano start with a small supply to promote scarcity which in turn drives up market valuation provided there is adoption of their token. This is an important consideration. The only way Shiba could “moon” (as some say in the Shiba Reddit forums) is if they intend to burn more tokens. To facilitate this some community members have pledged to burn portions of their Shiba holdings. Will it work? It could if enough people do it but no way of knowing for sure

2. Offerings: ShibaSwap is their biggest selling point. They intend to create an exchange where artists and others can trade Shiba Inu inspired tokens like “BONE” and “LEASH.” Can’t find much more info on this currently. Should that worry me? Another important question. In my view transparency is paramount

3. Community: a strong project has an army of dedicated community members who truly believe in the value of the project and consistently seek to add value. So far after scouring the Reddit forums I only see people interested in pumping up the price. There may very be people who care about the project on other forums but I haven’t looked at those yet. 

Overall my biggest question mark is what they said on their website under the header “Ecosystem”. They said “SHIB is an experiment in decentralized community building.” What does this mean anyway?

Also, I like the idea of having an artist incubator. But for Shiba Inu artists? Is there even a market for that? These are important questions to ask. 

Personally, their monetary policy puts me off. It could go up again or it could stay down like it is currently. But if you’re reason for buying into a token is because it will go up then just call it gambling.

How’s my analysis? Am I missing something here?

P.S. my dad bought 100 million Shiba tokens and is now digging on Shibaswap. Thoughts on this?",0.021,0.848,0.131,0.9927

"So friends, against the advice of “experienced” crypto people, i decided to invest in something they call “shitcoin”. I invested in Kangal, about 3 months ago. Now they said why not invest in Doge or Akita or something - also dog coins, but already successful? Well, the reason is because i generally like new projects. I like Start-Ups and the challenges they bring. What’s the deal with this one you ask? For one, it s not only a meme coin, it s a Project with a plan, a plan that brings real utility behind it, to drive demand and of course price also. I looked at the plan, i ve also discussed with the dev team which seemed quite committed to see it done. 

Now here s the catch, we have a stable base of holders, tokenomics are well balanced I d say. However not too many transactions at the moment, meaning not so much funds for marketing to drive awareness. Although the devs are launching new stuff as promised - take staking recently lanuched, 2 weeks ago, - we don t really shout it out to increase our base. Even more, new dapps are coming, the ecosystem for the coin will grow.

"So, what is staking? Staking is the process of blocking your cryptocurrency in the blockchain to receive rewards. Staking is possible only in projects that work according to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model. In such projects, network security and transaction confirmation are provided by so-called validators. And as a rule, the more money the validator has blocked, the greater his reward will be. To put it very roughly, staking is the same mining, but it is not the one who has more computing power of ASICs and video cards who earns here, but the one who has invested more money. Okay, I hope now you understand what staking is. Let's see if there are any pitfalls? Spoiler alert-yes.

&amp;#x200B;

First, to start staking, in most cases, you must transfer the cryptocurrency to the blockchain. This means that you will need to transfer your coins from the exchange to the native (native) wallet of your cryptocurrency. It sounds more complicated than it really is, but you still have to dig in and figure it out. Secondly, there is a risk of delegating your funds to an unscrupulous validator. The PoS system is designed in such a way that a validator can be punished for bad behavior by ""deleting"" his money. Bad behavior can be interruptions in the operation of the validator or errors in the configuration of the equipment. Therefore, it is very important to Google and delegates your funds to a reliable validator. Thirdly, each project has its own rules and nuances: the minimum number of coins for staking, the period of blocking and withdrawal of funds, etc. All this should be taken into account.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get to the interesting part. My Top 5 cryptocurrencies for staking:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Polygon (MATIC)

MATIC is currently the best solution to the problem of scaling the Ethereum network. More than 80% of all MATIC are at stake. This is one of the highest rates among cryptocurrencies. This means that the project has an incredible level of trust from investors. 

&amp;#x200B;

Annual income: 17-22%

&amp;#x200B;

2. Polkadot (DOT)

&amp;#x200B;

Polkadot is a project created by the co-founder of Ethereum. At the moment, no significant projects have been launched in the Polkadot ecosystem, but already its market capitalization has reached about $40 billion. Of which more than $27 billion has been frozen. This means that investors are very positive and show strong confidence in the project. 

&amp;#x200B;

Annual income: 13-14%

&amp;#x200B;

3. Binance Smart Chain (BNB)

&amp;#x200B;

I think BNB needs no introduction. The token of the ecosystem of the largest exchange in the world. At the time of writing this post, more than $5 billion of tokens have been frozen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Annual income: 16-20%

&amp;#x200B;

4. Terra (LUNA)

&amp;#x200B;

LUNA is a DeFi project, the purpose of which is to provide the opportunity to create stablecoins tied to the exchange rate of fiat currencies. Terra also offers solutions to the issue of providing payment solutions. At the moment, about $5.5 billion has been frozen, with a market capitalization of $6.5 billion. Again, this is a sign of investor confidence. 

&amp;#x200B;

Annual income: 11-17%

&amp;#x200B;

5. Fantom (FTM)

&amp;#x200B;

The project is essentially a competitor to MATIC. It is also trying to solve the problem of scalability of the Ethereum network. While MATIC'y is losing, but it is still not clear to me personally which of them will be the winner. FTM has an excellent marketing team and several key cooperation agreements with the governments of several countries: the United Arab Emirates (Dubai), Ukraine, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Annual yield: 11-13%

I was once on the interstate with my mom as a kid.

As I played Pokemon Pikachu Version I burped. To which I went to say excuse me but was interrupted by a sneeze mid-sentence. The positioning of my body caused the sneeze to propelled me to do a crunch. My head went between my legs, and the pressure on my abdomen pushed a powerful fart out directly into my face. 


As I was mid-sentence and just let out all of my breath via sneeze, as I'm coming up from the sneeze I'm inhaling. Inhaling not only that entire fart, but whatever burp I belched out too.

"People love to dismiss or throw shade on pure ""currency"" coins lately, and I think that's kinda messed up. Even michael saylor does it, on every interview he's constantly referring to Bitcoin as a pure SOV &amp; constantly shits on coins that aim to be ""digital currency"". The reason i say that's messed up is because it doesn't take a ton of digging to figure out that Satoshi's vision for bitcoin was for it to be able to function as digital cash. The title of the Btc white paper is literally, ""Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System"". There's no ambiguity as to Satoshi's vision, his vision was a decentralized, open source, secure digital cash

But sadly these days it seems like pure currency coins that are aiming to act as the best form of digital cash don't get the most attention or respect. Coins with smart contracts and/or staking are getting all the attention, while the coins that simply aim to be the optimal, ""electronic cash"", per Satoshi's vision, wallow in the rankings. 

Personally i think we're in a defi/ smart contract hype bubble, and although those things are great innovations and will be around for a long time, it still feels like pure currency coins aren't getting enough attention or respect as they deserve.",0.042,0.768,0.19,0.9904

"Despite claims of “decentralization”, the cryptocurrency industry is controlled by a powerful cartel of wealthy figures who, with time, have evolved to incorporate many of the same institutions tied to the existing centralized financial system they supposedly set out to replace.

Financial exploitation undoubtedly existed before cryptocurrency, but cryptocurrency is almost purpose built to make the funnel of profiteering more efficient for those at the top and less safeguarded for the vulnerable.

Cryptocurrency is like taking the worst parts of today's capitalist system (eg. corruption, fraud, inequality) and using software to technically limit the use of interventions (eg. audits, regulation, taxation) which serve as protections or safety nets for the average person.

Lose your savings account password? Your fault.
Fall victim to a scam? Your fault.
Billionaires manipulating markets? They’re geniuses.

This is the type of dangerous “free for all” capitalism cryptocurrency was unfortunately architected to facilitate since its inception.

But these days even the most modest critique of cryptocurrency will draw smears from the powerful figures in control of the industry and the ire of retail investors who they’ve sold the false promise of one day being a fellow billionaire. Good-faith debate is near impossible.

For these reasons, I simply no longer go out of my way to engage in public discussion regarding cryptocurrency. It doesn't align with my politics or belief system, and I don't have the energy to try and discuss that with those unwilling to engage in a grounded conversation.

I applaud those with the energy to continue asking the hard questions and applying the lens of rigorous skepticism all technology should be subject to. New technology can make the world a better place, but not when decoupled from its inherent politics or societal consequences.

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone”

The team at Feeder Finance are probably the most dedicated, honest and responsive I've seen in this space. They have been about for a few months now, quietly working on their DeFi products.

"Hi everyone,

For years I had subscribed to the view that crypto (Bitcoin on particular) was just a massive speculative bubble ready to pop at any moment.

But around 6 months I began to more deeply research blockchain, the downside of Keynsian economic policies, the scarce nature of Bitcoin, and the libertarian in me quickly fell in love.

I put some money into major alts, made a decent few dollars on the shit coin casino that was in SSB a few months ago and RE-invested my returns mainly into BTC, XMR and Algo.

Now I'm down around 40/50% but I'm feeling so calm inside. To me, this is clearly the future of finance and I just keep on stacking.

NOW TO MY QUESTION-I have read a lot about bear markets and the associated extreme fear and psychogical urge to sell to avoid further losses. Are people really feeling this? Surely we can go lower? I'm really not feeling the pain.

"Researching for a friend who lost 3100 XRP in a 3/1 scam on Telegram

A good friend of mine who is retired and a crypto novice as am I recently participated in a 2 year celebration campaign for Binance through  Telegram “XRP OFFICIAL CHAT” group wherein it stated if you exchange from 500 to 100,000 XRP (&amp; other coins) they will return 3/1 back to your wallet. He sent them 3100 &amp; when they confirmed it they stayed his wallet had an unconfirmed address and he needed to deposit another 2000 XRP to complete his account transaction. He uses Uphold and Uphold thankfully holds USA customers to a 64 day cooling off period otherwise he most likely would have lost 5000 instead of 3100. When he informed them of that they told him to figure it out and even have friends send him the other 2000. He even went to the FBI &amp; an online help company called “reclaim crypto” to assist in the recovery of his stolen 3100 XRP.

"I think well have small inflation. Within 1% of 2% on a 10 year frame. There are a lot of deflationary pressures as well. Things like ai, robotics, crypto are making things more efficient at an incredible rate. These will show on companies financial reports

The lasting inflation pressures: wages, quantative easening, services and entertainment costs, and possibly real estate/market valuations. Although if there some epic crash everyone keeps blabbing on about then valuations will crash and that wouldnt be lasting. 

Temporary inflation pressures: commodity prices, chip shortage, global supply chain failures and shortcomings, food prices, parents not working because schools/daycares are closed, oil prices. 

The rich are scared of any inflation. And they have convinced the general public that inflation is the worst thing that could happen (small inflation is good, it encourages money to be spent/invested not saved and an economy needs money to flow around to actually grow the economy, US gdp doesnt get anywhere if everyone just puts all their money in the bank.) So just like how the rich convinced people to be against raising the minimum wage (letting the masses fight their battle for them) they have convinced poor people that inflation is the worst thing that could happen (again letting the masses fight their battle for them.) While not realising that inflation is bad for protecting wealth (rich people lose money) and good for creating it (money moves around more fluidly which gives the lower class better access to it and good credit to increase their own flow).

"I see many on this sub getting high or depressed based on their crypto of choice's value relative to fiat money. I know many on this sub are probably hoping to moon and then sell back to fiat, but let me offer a different perspective. Looking up how much your crypto is worth compared to dollars and letting that impact your emotions only matters is you plan on one day selling all your crypto and depending on fiat currency. My plan is to never sell. I truly believe that in my lifetime (and I'm not a young buck) we will be using crypto as currency and I will be converting all my fiat to crypto.

I own a small business. As much as I want to, I currently don't accept crypto payments as the volatility of crypto relative to fiat is too large and by the time the crypto settles in my account and converts to fiat it could crush my margins. This problem is only a problem because I have to purchase materials, make pay roll, pay rent, etc. in fiat money. If I was able to accept crypto and pay all my bills in crypto then the value relative to fiat doesn't matter. This may sound simple, but if you sit down and fully understand this then you may start looking at your crypto holdings differently. There may come a day when Bitcoin, ETH, XRP, ADA, or (insert your favorite crypto here) is so widely accepted that Crypto is no longer really volatile relative to fiat, but fiat is actually volatile relative to crypto. There may come a day when you pay rent/mortage in crypto, earn money in crypto, pay for food in crypto, etc.. At that point the value of your crypto relative to some fiat standard is meaningless. This is the day when you will hear, ""Man the dollar is only worth 0.0001 ETH, bad day to own dollars. The dollar is so volatile""

I realize this is an over simplification. However realize that in my lifetime there has never been a new asset class created before until crypto. I want to offer this perspective because I see so many people's happiness/sadness tied to the value of their crypto relative to dollars. Crypto has the power to change the world and the way money works. There is a chance you may never convert your crypto to fiat and one day may be rushing to convert all your fiat to crypto before your fiat currency value tanks relative to crypto. If you are hoping to one day not hold any crypto and convert all back to fiat then you are a speculator and trader and that is fine. If you truly believe in the technology and the power this has to change the way the world works then you may never have to realize your loss or gains back to fiat and may be using the crypto you currently hold as true currency.

"Everyone wants to invest in blockchain. At least, that’s the impression one gets from the daily funding announcements that are eagerly reported by crypto news media.

There's little doubt that digital currencies have seen remarkable growth. Spurred on by the incredible growth of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the field of cryptocurrencies has only continued to expand. Many digital currency enthusiasts believe that these investments could produce a new batch of digital currency millionaires (or billionaires).Another common reason to invest in cryptocurrency is the desire for a reliable, long-term store of value.

Unlike fiat money, most cryptocurrencies have a limited supply, capped by mathematical algorithms. This makes it impossible for any political body or government agency to dilute their value through inflation. Moreover, due to the cryptographic nature of cryptocurrencies, it is impossible for a government body to tax or confiscate tokens without the cooperation of the owner.

This property makes cryptocurrency attractive to people who are worried about hyperinflationary events, bank failures, or other disaster scenarios. Bitcoin in particular has attracted attention due to its deflationary and censorship-resistant properties, leading proponents to describe it as ""digital gold.""

One of the most impressive and unique aspects of cryptocurrency is also a significant liability. Since cryptocurrency does not rely on a central intermediary, it falls on the user to safely store the cryptographic keys which control their blockchain address. Investors who choose to explore the digital currency space should be aware that a number of special security measures are absolutely necessary, and that even those measures may not sufficiently protect their holdings against hackers working constantly to refine their techniques.

###health care

Endless promises of better health care only to have to price go up for everyone, point the finger at both parties, then say you're giving free care to anyone who wanders in from another country, then stick us with that bill too.     Thanks. 

I had my $150 a month health insurance cancelled on me, and was forced to buy a $325 a month plan (cheapest I can find) becaue of ""affordable thing"" that was supposed to be better for us or get a $1000 penalty for not having insurance?  Really

###Car insurance

Everyone on my block had their car insurance rates go up because a neighbor on my block got into a drunk driving accident on our street. 
He hopped the curb and ran into a parked car. Not insane. But enough to cause good damage

 So now I have to spend and extra $15 yearly because it's possible he might get behind the wheel, and ram everyone on the block even though he lives at the corner and normally wouldn't drive down my dead end street just to turn around again. 



Point I'm trying to make is that we always have to dish out our hard earned money because of what someone else did. 

We are constantly paying for what others did.

In crypto, I don't have to pay additional penalties.  If Gas fees Triple out of no where, I can simply switch to another crypto and avoid all those fees.  I don't get a penalty for not paying double or triple.  

Nobody is gonna force me to use another crypto that's more expensive with double the gas fees because someone passed ""affordable crypto act"" 

It might take my money too but at least it gives me a chance to win 1000x on my money.   

The only 1000x I'm getting with the system through is they will want a 1000x more from me.  They don't even have the courtesy to put my name In a tax lottery. Just take take take.

Crypto won't do that to you.    It's going up or it's going down.  No tricks, just straight forward and it lets you know when it's taking your money.  You can watch it disappear. 

With he system you don't know when they are taking your money. You can get your bank acc frozen out of the blue. Taxes can go up at anytime.  There is no time to plan. No cashing out early so I only have to pay a portion of the tax. None of that. Just *GIMMIE YOUR MONEY ITS MINE NOW*

I’m aware it’s a major long shot, I’m trying to help out one of my moms friends but if the immediate feedback is it’s a lost cause then I’ll delete the post. If something helpful comes along I’ll leave it up for visibility.

Anyhoo, my moms friend had a broker friend post on Facebook about 8 years “EVERYONE SHOULD BUY BITCOIN RIGHT NOW!” And then he posted a link to some site you could purchase from. Apparently she trusted him and went for it and purchased a little over $40,000 in BTC which is likely worth many millions today. Now here comes the fun part, she of course doesn’t remember how she stored the Bitcoin or the site she purchased it from just that she had it in a wallet.

So far my suggestions were as follows;

-	Have her search her email she used to purchase the Bitcoin for: Bitcoin, crypto, recovery, phrase, transfer, wallet
-	Reach out to either or both of these companies and walk them through the little info you have to see if they can help;
-	https://keychainx.com/
-	https://www.walletrecoveryservices.com/

There’s a obvious one missing which would be to ask the guy what site he posted, but of course he didn’t buy any himself and shortly after deleted the post cause the company he worked for caught wind and didn’t like it. So there’s no way to go back through his feed to find it and he doesn’t remember.

"So this might be terrible idea, or maybe its something that's been thought of, and either implemented or rejected for good reason. - let me know.

FYI: I'm new to crypto ... so I'm fairly ignorant on a lot of things.

It's my understanding that its possible with some coins, like BTC that have a limited supply, that its possible to ""loose"" certain individual coins or stashes, effectively removed from circulation. This isn't to say that the coins disappear, they remain on the block chain, but because a password was lost or the owner dies and doesn't leave a way for the crypto be be accessed by someone else the coins will remain permanently static effectively removing them from actual, available  supply, .... even though they are right there .... still on the Block Chain.... visible, but not accessible.


Has anyone had the idea for making a Crypto that will recirculate static coins if they sit, intraded, for an extended period of time? 
The ""use-it-or-loose-it"" coin?

Would this be an advantage for a coins usefulness, or a hunderance?

Obviously no one would want to buy a coin that could disappear from your wallet because it was on a ""use it or loose it"" timer that ran out, .... but would it be advantageous for a static coin to be automatically reenter circulation (by being reissued to a miner, let's say) , after a VERY long period of inactivity?  

I'm thinking like 100 to 200 years of inactivity so that it doesn't hurt the long term investor AND in order to restart ""the clock"", you just had to transfer it to a diferent wallet, which could be done as part of estate plan so you still pass it on as generational wealth.

But people are falable.  There will always be passwords lost or unexpected deaths resulting in ""lost coins"", right? 

Would automated recirculation insure that there would be a continuous source of coins for future miners instead of relying on whatever it is that BTH is planning to pay miners with after the last coin is issued?

Again... I'm new and this is just a crazy spot ball post.

" I’ve been sniffing around the Xdai network and projects built on it because I do believe we’ll have a multi-chain feature. I stumbled on a project called Rarecoin and have been claiming their daily faucet for over a month now. 

In case you don’t know what faucets are, they are essentially a way to distribute free crypto to users. Many early Bitcoin holders got their stash via faucets. 

For Rare, the payout is roughly $0.21 daily depending on the market price of the coin **(it used to be $0.4 when I started)** on the day, and to be honest, I probably shouldn’t be sharing this. 

This is because the more people registered to claim, the lower the amount handed out to each user. Rare has a very limited supply of 36500 coins, and 2 coins are evenly distributed to those who register to claim them daily.

If you’re looking for some passive income (I know it won’t mean much to the rich guys here, but it does mean something for those living in less developed countries, and humble Moon farmers :), then you can hop on this.

The claim process is also relatively simple, especially if you already have a wallet connected to Xdai. If you don’t, then no worries. 

**Here’s how to do it:**

1. Add Xdai as a Custom RPC to your Metamask wallet (either extension or mobile).

Use the following details: 

**Network Name:** xDai

**New RPC URL:** https://rpc.xdaichain.com/​

**Chain ID:** 0x64

**Symbol:** xDai

**Block Explorer URL:** [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet)

1. You will need some Xdai to cover the transaction fees for the initial registration. You can claim some from the xdai faucet here [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet)
2. Once you have some Xdai, you need to Register on the BrightID app to verify your humanity. Don’t worry you can learn how to do it here: [https://rare.fyi/rare-news/brightid/](https://rare.fyi/rare-news/brightid/)
3. Once verified, you can now register on the [https://rare.claims/](https://rare.claims/) app to start claiming. Note that there’s a 0.1 Xdai tax for registering for each daily claim, but what you claim covers that cost.
4. You can exchange the claimed Rare for your preferred currency on Honeyswap (Xdai’s equivalent of Uniswap). Fees cost roughly $0.0002.

The process may seem pretty lengthy, but I do believe it’s worth it. After all, it’s free money and Rare has a very limited supply as mentioned earlier. They also have an amazing and really helpful community of members and developers building really cool stuff to improve utility.",0.031,0.879,0.09,0.9776

"For those of you who don't already know, you receive a 20% bonus for holding your moons each month that you don't sell. In addition, you receive another 5% bonus for voting in governance polls. So even if you just take the moons you receive today, never comment on here again, but vote once a month and don't sell, you will effectively accumulate an additional 25% more moons each month. 

So let's say, you receive 1,000 moons from this month's distribution, if you held for twelve months (and voted) by this time next year you will have 14,552 moons in your wallet. Based on current price ($0.092) those moons would be worth $1,339, as opposed to the $92 they are worth today. That is a 14.5x increase for less than five minutes effort each month. The only way your moons will be worth less in 12 months time than today, is if the price falls to $0.0065 (a 92.93% fall in value). 

Given the potential upside of moons (imo $1 is not unthinkable in the next year), there is very little reason to sell your moons now, and much more reason to wait a year and see what happens.

"Unit bias is the concept that buyers are more enticed to buy a whole unit of a given currency instead of a fractional quantity. Many newbies (myself included at one point) hold the irrational view that BTC or ETH are simply too expensive and hence look into “cheaper” coins that they can own more units of. This leads them into make much more riskier investments and buying and hodling a sketchy altcoin with no long-term prospects.

You should be more focused on percentage gains instead. Having 0.1 units of a coin that goes up 1000% is better than having 1000 units of a coin that goes up 1%. Although sub-$1 altcoins are enticing, it’s crucial to evaluate assets on their merits, including their tokenomics, developer team, originality, liquidity, and circulating supply. If you want to speculate, you should be looking at low marketcap coins that you believe in and that have **strong fundamentals with high growth potential, not just a cheap price.**

Strip unit bias out of the equation and those dirt cheap coins might start to look a lot dirtier than they do cheap.

"A couple years ago, I was having all of the above problems. I would set my PC to sleep, walk out the room and I'd come back in and it would still be on. The CPU was idling at 50-60c with a very expensive CPU cooler on it. The fans seemed to be whirring constantly. On top of that, the games I played seemed to performing worse.  

I'm no stranger to PC diagnosis, but this one had me stumped. Every time I pressed CTRL+ALT+DEL and looked in Task Manager, I couldn't find any trace of any program using my CPU, yet my PC seemed to be ""in use"" every hour of day.  

Finally I noticed every time I checked my processes in the Task Manager, the temperature on my PC would start to drop and the fans stopped spinning.  

I started to get sus and downloaded MalwareBytes which is a well-known tool for finding and kicking the shit out of viruses and malware. Thankfully, it's free to use so I had nothing to lose. I ran the scan on my C: Drive and immediately it found a Trojan.  

MalwareBytes provided the name of this Trojan and on googling it, I found it was a *stealth Monero Cryptominer* - whenever you use normal methods to check for viruses, such as Task Manager, it turns itself off..  

*... Clever girl.*

I love Bitcoin but working for Vitalik's vision would be all I could ever ask from the world. So I've set my sights on it.

I'm taking the beginner Computer Science course Harvard is offering (google Harvard CS50 if you're interested, it's free) and I'm learning Python on top of working so my time is already tight and I don't want to do any filler courses.

"Have you ever done something in life where you wish you could have another opportunity or a do over  to correct either a bad first impression or to be a part of something someone had told you about but you for some reason or another didn't partake in? The old saying sitting in the back of your head ""You only get one shot at a first impression"" gnawing at your mind leaving you either cussing yourself, feeling defeated, feeling embarrassed, or downright feeling depressed. Meanwhile those who nailed it stand there beating their chests with an almost arrogance to them while they know they hit it out of the park or are sitting on a gold mine that others missed out on adding more fuel to your fire ultimately leaving you despising them and or the opportunity and forever leaving a bad taste in your mouth.............. WELL LIFE IS GIVING THOSE INDIVIDUALS LEMONS AGAIN AND IT IS IN THE FORM OF THE SAFEST TOKEN ON THE BSC NETWORK

**ULTRASAFE**

With all the crazy hype these previous months especially early on before the current bear market many people were deciding to jump into crypto and trying to snipe the next big hype token, or the next big moon, while at the same time trying to time it right and capture profits before the ultimate crash which seemed to be almost written into the **DNA** of every new project coming out on the network. Millionaires were made, memes were spread, while others were left bitter missing the opportunity to be a part of the craziness that is and always will be crypto and its crazy ups and downs and in their particular cases more downs than ups. Money they had worked hard to save up and earn disappeared almost magically in front of their eyes as whales sold, markets crashed, and projects promising fortune and famed were rug pulled in front of their eyes or honey potted leaving the holders with $0 money and the ""UN-DOXXED"" devs with pockets lined with cash..... The fraud that was running rampant was almost accepted as a normal thing because these so called ""meme tokens or shit coins"" were everywhere now and some making people very rich over night........ BUT seeing the way fraud was being accepted, seeing people lose hundreds and thousands of dollars, and seeing the new projects on the BSC network were getting coined with the term ""ShitCoin"" one group of DEVS came up with an **IDEA** and a **SOLUTION** to this problem and brought their expertise together to form the **PROJECT** **ULTRASAFE**............

With the creation of their project and token they set out to change the way the BSC network was perceived and made sure that they put **SAFETY** and **SECURITY** as the **#1 BUILDING BLOCK** for their project. They came together and had the projects 1ST AUDIT before they launched, and shortly after **THEIR 2ND AUDIT ""CERTIK""** shortly after their launch. With their advanced **TOKENOMICS**, well laid out **WHITEPAPERS** and a promise to change the way and culture of BSC projects they came out of the gates RUNNING breaking all sorts of records and achieving an **$80,000,000 MARKET CAP** within the FIRST 48 HOURS!!!!!! Many people bought in as THOUSANDS of HOLDERS were added daily, smashing through walls, and unlocking many of the phases within the project within the first week of the projects launch. 

**PR FIRMS** secured, **AMBASSADORS** added, **NEW YORK BILLBOARDS** in place, new website versions, **PARTNERSHIPS** with **AERDROP AND RUBIC** as well staking on the way, **DIRECT BUY WITH FIAT** on the way and soooooooo much more. The price was flying the holders making money and many people thought they had missed their opportunity yet again............. or so they thought........

The **WHOLE CRYPTO MARKET** decided it was time for a bear run and rather then continue on the trend of going up and **ALL CRYPTO SETTING NEW ATH's** (all time highs) prices began to drop and projects that were promising life changing things were falling to the way side with the vast majority of new projects that had started before the bear run no longer even being a live and active project. However, little did people know that while all of this was going on the **ULTRASAFE** **TEAM** were endlessly working on all of their foundations to offset all of the bear market and fud being spread throughout the **CRYPTO** **COMMUNITY**....... While other token/projects were scamming and pretending to be something they were not **THE DEVS** in **ULTRASAFE** were **TIRELESSLY** working to secure new partnerships, **GET THEIR LLC**, communicating with the community daily and holding multiple AMA's every week to make sure that **WE THE COMMUNITY** knew they were feeling the pain and were doing EVERYTHING in their power to progress this **AMAZING PROJECT**. Lining up interviews with **BENZINGA**, new marketing campaigns tailored to the **ASIAN MARKET**, as well get everything foundation wise stronger then it has ever been because once the **MARKET RECOVERS** and IT WILL they as well as all of **OUR COMMUNITY** knows where this is headed. While other projects were scamming **ULTRASAFE** has been gearing up for their **EPIC RISE** to the top. Not just to the top like others have done for small periods of time but a **METEORIC RISE** where we **STAY THERE** and become not only the **BEST PROJECT** on the BSC network but also the **SAFEST PROJECT** as well while providing information on the crypto market as a whole **EDUCATING** investors about **CRYPTO**, **SAFETY**, and the **IN's and OUT's** of what to look for in a project as well as providing **REAL TIME UTILITY.**

So where does this lead us to now you ask????

Well if you have made it this far through and haven't already been sold on **ULTRASAFE** as a project the entry point certainly will. Buying in now would give a **15.2X** **return** just returning to our ATH   
""**WHICH WE WILL BLOW PAST**"" but more importantly it gives you a **SECOND** **CHANCE** for a **FIRST** **TIME IMPRESSION** and access to the greatest opportunity on the BSC NETWORK with a **FULLY DOXXED DEV TEAM, AMAZING COMMUNITY, MULTIPLE PARTNERSHIPS, CROSS PLATFORM BUYING, DIRECT BUY WITH FIAT, STAKING, NFT MARKETPLACE AND SO MUCH MORE....... ALL AT LAUNCH DAY PRICING......**

I write this not to convince you that **ULTRASAFE** is the best ""which it is"" but rather I write this to give those who missed the opportunity the first time around on this a second chance. A second chance to become part of something special, a second chance to change your life, and a second chance to be a part of something truly great!!!!!! Invest at your own risk and do your due diligence as this is not financial advice, rather this a Whale speaking to all of the fish in the crazy sea of crypto and letting you know that at **ULTRASAFE** the water is perfect, the timing couldn't be better and **THE FUTURE COULDN'T BE BRIGHTER** than it is right now!!!!!

Thank you to all who took the time to read this and may all of you be showered with blessings and achieve all of the things in life that you wanting!!!!

"Hey guys hope all is well. Not so familiar with Reddit or ever really used this platform. I wanted to reach out since I have a unique system of retrieving back funds that were stolen due to sim swaps. Back in 2020 I had my Bitcoin stolen due to a sim swap. I was under a ton of stress trying to figure out how to resolve the issue. After a couple months of calls, research and sweat I realized there was no one that could help me or wanted to help out at the least. I decided to take matters into my own hands and thankfully figured out a way to receive a settlement with the telecommunication companies. I specifically use T-Mobile and have used my process with a handful of people. I’ve never tried other providers but I’m willing to give it a shot. I charge 30% of whatever is received and never settle without the consent of my clients. Looking forward to some inquiries and seeing how I can help out.",0.052,0.858,0.089,0.5928

I'm quite a new to crypto. I started after may's dip and i was waiting for a dip so i could get onboard with crypto.
So far everything is good, i dont mind if prices drop more.

So my plan is to invest 250€ every other week like this:
btc 35%
eth &amp; ada combined 30%
link &amp;hbar combined 25%
vechain, solana, theta combined 10%

"Moons were supposed to increase the quality of the posts in this sub by offering a financial incentive for it. Like a quality control mechanism. Well, I guess we can all agree things may not have worked out exactly as planned. 

It is very surprising to me though how the top comments on a post will be that it is low quality case of moon farming but the post at the same time will have thousands of upvotes. Like who is upvoting this stuff and then complaining about it in the comments lol. 

I only upvote and comment on really well written and informative posts that teach me something, some important news, handy tips and tricks for newcomers, or really funny posts.

"Can anyone tell me what's going on with Hex / PulseChain?

Hex always had a pretty scammy vibe to me, but I know some people that got in early and are doing quite well. I never got in because of the thing with the Origin Address (Richard Heart?) having 50% of all the funds. People somehow skirt passed this as if it's not a thing? The vibes that RH gives off just feel weird to me, and the whole idea of 'donations' and 'sacrifices' seems like shifty wording to obscure himself from legal liabilities.

I don't understand the econonomics of Hex. I get that it's like a CD, you put in X hex, locked for a period of time, then get out X+% hex. Is the current rising price just due to supply being limited because most is staked? Once these staking terms unlock and people start dumping, won't there be a huge downtrend? 

&amp;#x200B;

PulseChain is an Ethereum fork/airdrop w/ staking, mainly seems to be trying to capitalize on the fact that Eth 2.0 hasn't release yet, and to whip of lots of FOMO with people getting airdropped tokens becoming your marketing network.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something I'm missing? Is there any actual interesting technology here, or all just marketing and FOMO? Are there any forks of something similar to Hex, but without the Origin Address? Seems like it would be very easy to do, as it's just a single smart contract that once launched can't be changed (code finalized).

&amp;#x200B;

The entire space of open source networks is so interesting to watch play out over time, as people can leapfrog others by just copy&amp;pasting the code that other teams spent so long building and then claim it as their own. Humans are interesting creatures, indeed...",0.036,0.814,0.15,0.9909

The Token has no value at it is now.

this is the contract adress 0x695226EB7A5202996D1a62042B54CF6eddf9EB56  
I used a pre created ERC 20 solidity Contract and changed the name+max supply and the Symbol.

My plan for the real Token would be something like this:  
max supply: 100  
decimals: 8  


* Mint those on the ETH smart chain.
* Create a Luqidity on UniSwap with 80 Tokens and 80 Euros. Lock this Liquidity pool for ever if this works?? 
* 10 Tokens are mine and 10 Tokens will be distributed on, you guessed it right, reddit since I have no other friends.   


So my questions now:

  
Is it a stupid Idea to create a token just for fun ?   
I am not technically skilled, so should I seek help from someone who actually knows what he/she is doing ?   


By the way if you want some of my lovely Token i can send you some test Eth and some lovely tokens so you can test them out. It's all on the Testnet so it has no value but trasfering works just fine.

Right, but that only works when people 1) Are afraid enough to lose purchasing power so they take the time to educate en buy a highly volatile asset and 2) enough people believe it stores value and new people keep joining the network.

PROTOCOL chains. Now this time around we have protocols with native currencies facilitating Dapps. Those native currencies like ether in ethereum could be programmed similar to bitcoin tokennomic wise. 

It is like a store of value but not ONLY because people think it is. It has actual utility within a network of thousands of dapps with billions of dollars floating through each day in the not so distant future! Think of transaction fees, staking incentives, voting power and certain benefits within the system. 

Some protocol will flip bitcoin and when the #1 spot is gone it will lose momentum and fame pretty quickly in my view.

Also, could someone give me advice on the risks and what to watch out for with pump and dump schemes as well? Like what are the risks I should be aware of? How do we avoid these risks, and what are the most profitable yield farming strategies?",0.104,0.742,0.154,0.8873
