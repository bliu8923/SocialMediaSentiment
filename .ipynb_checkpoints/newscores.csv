0,"Talking to Your Parents about Crypto - Hi everyone, dropping my first post here to get some advice on how best to discuss crypto with your parents. Appreciate any advice and would just like to say wow, what an awesome community to look through, amazing stuff!

Anyways...

For years I've been an avid crypto and bitcoin enthusiast, and I mostly keep to myself on the topic. I usually discuss it with my best friend and that's it. However, I am very close with my parents (both mid-60's), and from time to time I bring it up with them because it interests me quite a bit.

Well,  every time I talk with my parents about the topic, they mostly want to change the subject, and we don't get very far. Usually I'll bring up a topic like Bitcoin and basically the conversation nevers gets very far...no follow-up questions, dad brings up gold, mother in law calls it ""Bitecoin"",etc.  I'm sure many of you know what I'm talking about.

From all the recent news and my personal experience, there seems to be a large generational divide on the topic.

So basically, if anyone has had any success, what advice do you have, or resources have you shared with your parents/others to help bridge the generational crypto divide?

P.S. After having written this, it feels like a Dear Abby letter now.",0.0,0.782,0.218,0.9948

5,"Explaining leverage and how scary, and profitable, it can be - A lot of people on this sub know about leverage and how bad it is for new investors, I'm not going to outright shame anyone for using 2x or 3x leverage, but I am going to give some statistics that may sway people to, or away from leverage investing.

&amp;#x200B;

I went ahead and made this easy, 2/19/21 I bought 1btc, I then leveraged it 1x, 10x, and 100x. (in real life I seriously doubt any credible place will give you 100x leverage ever, most places don't even do 30x anymore)

&amp;#x200B;

basically with this leverage, you have 30k\~, but you have the buying power of 300k, or 3 million. 

&amp;#x200B;

let's look at the statistics for this scenario we made up.

&amp;#x200B;

[1,10,100x leverage visual](https://preview.redd.it/etyqkb5v62h71.png?width=735&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ab74033c5732354004804cbbb1ce8acca6759e2)

with the buying power of 30k, with 100x leverage currently, you would be at a net gain of nearly a million dollars.. that's pretty cool, right? ok but you also just bought in at the best time when bitcoin was rallying insanely. 

but what if you bought at the top of the bull run? **like an epic Redditor**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[value of 1 btc bought at 5\/11\/21 - 5\/26\/21. 1x leverage, 10x, 100x](https://preview.redd.it/s0lk1cm182h71.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd15e67bf79ff4f1490e40bcc29877afc92b5060)

you will be liquidated if you lose the amount of money you had as collateral, or 2x of it. so if you had 50k, and you lose 100k, you would first off lose the initial 50k you had, and you would owe 50k more, plus any other liquidation fees. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[1x,10x,100x leverage](https://preview.redd.it/kqml9r3r82h71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=672e0781eab621bca3804d2f1abd3ff061953c66)

&amp;#x200B;

In this instance, with 10x leverage, you would be liquidated in about 4-5 days. With 100x leverage, less than a day. it's not even on the graph.

&amp;#x200B;

leverage can be a nice tool for someone who truly knows shit about their investments. But the risks involved are so insane that if you do end up leverage trading it should most likely be only for 2-3x leverage, or you risk being liquidated too early before a massive bull run. This sub often defends new investors from making risky plays like day trading, investing in shitcoins, or leveraging, and I would say in this case it's fair to look at the negatives and point them out.",0.087,0.794,0.119,0.9541
6,"I am dying to an unknown illness (long) - 29 year old male here, I am taking damage over time and it's getting worse with everyday that goes by, I am dying slowly. I have to tell the truth here please believe me this is 100% true but no doctor cared when I told them the story and said I have to move on from the incident. 


8 years ago I was doing the things young adults do, drinking, smoking and what not. I was a virgin at the time and my friends told me about an escort website, and we just started talking about it and me being a virgin, I was semi interested but shrugged it off. One day me and my friends drank a lot and I was intoxicated, while being in this state and not having my mind, I decided to take the opportunity to experience something new and went onto the website.


I found an ad and decided to call her, I started regretting the action of calling her and try to cancel but it was already too late she came and knocked on my door. I opened the door and we went downstairs. She was Asian not sure what part but she was from overseas. This is where it happend, while being in a drunk state I remember her coughing every now and than, and she asked for tissues and she than proceeded to start blowing her nose. I was to drunk to release I can't go on with a sick escort, we kissed and did out thing and it was not even a good experience it was horrible. I woke up the next day with the biggest pain in my shoulder it was the weirdest sensation ever, I took a shower and something was very seriously wrong. Right Away I went to the doctor's I wore protection but did std tests nothing came out of it, did all the blood work and tests and nothing was wrong with me. After going through sepcialist after specialist I decided I am not getting anywhere and I stopped going.

The pain from my shoulder started to spread to my entire body over time, my muscles and tendons were getting tight, I was getting heat/cold sensations in my skin, I was getting electric pulses on my skin. Over time the illness spread into my head. All my head muscles are tight, my jaw is so tight and it's so hard to open it now and it clicks and pops and tears. I can hear my muscles and tendons in my head it's so tight. At the point I went to the hospital, nothing was wrong with me the tests were fine again, I tell them about the story but the doctors told me your tests are fine and nothing is wrong with you. I went to a heart specialist, did cat scans, x-rays, MRIs, nerve tests, rhematolgist, all gave different medicines but nothing worked. At this point I am exhausted and I just stopped going to the doctor

Years go by and it's getting worse with days, when you are getting worse and worse it's hard to do anything you have no energy, yes exercise helps but I am in agony and suffering, it's really hard to do. I have no more job, lost my health and I am seriously about to die I am not lying. Whatever this illness is it's trying to take my life with conviction. When you are in so much physical pain you end up with depression, along with this agony I am so sad and in despair all the time because of my illness, my chest feels like it's being taken over by darkness. 


I told my brother about my belongings because I am going to die soon to this illness, I went to a naturopath healer and he told me 30% of my energy is being used to pump bloodflow in my head, that's why it's so tight. I don't think my story has a happy ending im dead in the water. I never got to experience having a girlfriend, going to school and getting a good job and trying to make it in life, instead I contacted an unknown illness that I got from a sick escort and I have been slowly dying since. I have no friends because I have no energy to do anything, it's such a burden not to provide as a man I am living in my mom's basement with no job and a life threating illness, I am suffering 24/7, please don't throw random diagnoses at me, all I know what ever it is it's violent and demonic and is going to take my life.",0.205,0.725,0.07,-0.9992

* Process efficiency for underlying industry operations
* Reduced costs from process automation
* Access to global asset distribution
* Access to broader investor pools due to ownership fractionalization
* Access to secondary market opportunities
* Data accessibility to increase transparency and inform better investment decisions and portfolio management

I do follow 200+ accounts on twitter, all related to crypto, some devs, some designers, or other key people to cryptoprojects, some influencers or traders. And these past weeks i have been seeing new projects, or old projects that are recently ""discovered"" that are exploding, for example 10 days ago i saw some of these accounts writing about [https://etherrock.com/](https://etherrock.com/) , i enter the page and only 90 rocks have been minted -max amount of rocks are 100-, they were like 10 left, and to mint them they cost 9eth at that time... I sent it to my friends group and was like wtf look this, people are paying a lot for rocks! It has been there since 2017 and no one was minting them, but sudenly after some minutes, and some shilling of big accounts, they were aaaaall minted, and prices started to surge that now the cheapest rock is near 70 ETH!!! 

I have seen the same with Pudgy Penguin, price was like 0.0x ETH , some accounts started shilling, they started putting the photo in their profile, and the price sudenly started rising. It was something that was also already in there, people werent buying until the shilling started, now the floor price is above 1 ETH, from less than 2k owners now that they started selling their bags, its at more than 4k owners.

This was implemented into Monero but never Bitcoin. Many of the things he wanted Bitcoin to be never happened. Bitcoin is and I say this will full confidence a PUBLIC BANK ACCOUNT. Here’s an example, Walmart accepts Bitcoin, once you pay them they have access to all your previous transactions, how much you have and can black list you if they were to find out you donated to, or supported something they didn’t approve of. A public bank account is especially dangerous for p2p, let’s say you pay someone and they have the ability to see how much you have and previous transactions, this is dangerous for 3rd world countries that aren’t as safe as America where if people know how much you have, it won’t become an if but a WHEN you will get set up.

Miners need an incentive to mine. Because of the dynamic blocksize, competition between miners will cause fees to decrease. If mining is not profitable due to a high cost and low reward, miners lose their incentive and will stop mining, reducing the security of the network.

70,"Crypto believers want to know: What’s the carbon footprint of the US military? - Hello and good morning, here is an article from the financial Times that I found interesting. I didn't link it due to the possible paywall. Good reading, and have a nice day!

First, the obvious: Bitcoin mining uses a lot of electricity, so it’s bad for the environment. Anyone who claims otherwise is an ideologue or a fool. Arguing that mining drives investment in renewables, while true, is disingenuous, because all power consumption does. There are nuances to this debate, but none change the fact that Bitcoin has a significant carbon footprint.  

But so do a lot of things, especially when measured in aggregate. Tellingly, none are as controversial. What’s the carbon footprint of air conditioning? The US uses more power for that than the UK does in total, yet there is no shortage of crypto critics waxing poetic about boiling oceans from their comfortably cool offices. Every kind of human activity impacts the environment. Deciding which ones are worthwhile requires an objective cost-benefit analysis and comparison to similar activities. Bitcoin mining is rather unique, but for the sake of argument, let’s compare it to the US military. 

Like Bitcoin, the US military uses more energy than entire countries. Also like Bitcoin, a big reason why is to secure the purchasing power of a currency, in this case the dollar. But unlike Bitcoin, the military does this in a roundabout way, protecting unsavoury regimes and dropping the occasional bomb. It’s no coincidence that the petrodollar arrangement that turned the Middle East into America’s backyard was born right after the fall of Bretton Woods. Dollars no longer protected by bullion had to be backed with energy security, empowering oil-producing states which now became the de facto minters of the global reserve currency. 

The relationship between money and power is almost as old as money itself, with those issuing the former utilising the latter to ensure adoption. Even the most peaceful nations force their citizens to pay taxes in the local currency. Bitcoin’s clever contribution is to make this previously implicit relationship explicit. People trust its coins because they require a lot of power to produce. 

The ESG case for crypto starts with the recognition that the power consumption of mining is a feature, a crucial component of a novel security mechanism that achieves something remarkable: a global monetary system that is independent of any corporation or government, and strictly opt-in. There are no legal tender laws or naval fleets that force people to trust Bitcoin. And yet, hundreds of millions do, perhaps for that very reason. That trust wouldn’t exist if running the network wasn’t hard and creating new coins wasn’t expensive. Human beings don’t value things that aren’t hard to make. That’s why a hand-assembled automatic Swiss watch costs a thousand times more than a machine-made quartz one — despite the latter being better at telling time. 

The environmental cost of mining is further made up for by the resulting social benefits, money that’s opt-in has its perks. Crypto has no coercion. It uses transparency, math and economic incentives to build trust where it wouldn’t otherwise exist. Crypto is meritocratic. Anyone can do anything — from mining it, to using it, to saving it. Like Lady Justice herself, crypto is blind. It doesn’t care (or even know about) anyone’s nationality, race, age, gender or immigration status. It’s the first electronic payment system available to everyone, from undocumented workers in western countries to women in Islamist ones.

These features are needed now more than ever, thanks to the tragic failures of the traditional monetary system. Not in terms of debasement and inflation — though that may come later — but in terms of access. Over one and a half billion unbanked globally, most of them poor, undocumented, minority and innocent. That last adjective is important, because the exclusionary nature of our existing financial system is no accident. It is a direct consequence of a system built on a presumption of guilt.  

As proof, consider the simple fact that opening up a bank account is more intrusive than having open-heart surgery. Most industries operate on a presumption of innocence. They accept anyone as a customer, then kick out bad actors. Banking, as dictated by government regulation, works on the opposite principle. Everyone is a potential terrorist or money launderer until they prove otherwise. 

This presumption of guilt is a minor nuisance for the affluent, but an existential threat to the underprivileged. It’s one reason why poor neighbourhoods feature more pseudo-financial services like check cashers than bank branches, even in rich countries. Laws and regulations make it too hard or expensive for banks to serve these communities. Money that’s issued by a government must play by its rules, however overbearing or unfair they might be. 

Thanks to being decentralised and opt-in, crypto operates on a presumption of innocence. In theory, anyone can open a wallet, acquire some money and make payments, until they do something wrong. (Though conventional regulation has impeded this principle as it has come to impose itself on crypto). Nonetheless, as unusual as this approach sounds, it happens to be how cash has worked forever. Paper money doesn’t discriminate the way financial providers do. 

Sceptics argue that a financial system as open to undocumented Salvadoreans as affluent Americans is bound to be taken over by criminal activity. The inherent racism and classism of this argument aside, it fails a basic smell test. Despite its exclusionary tendencies, the existing system still enables a shocking amount of illicit activity. Global banks paid more in fines last year than the bad guys moved in bitcoins. Ransomware attacks like the Colonial Pipeline one might get all the attention, but credit card and wire fraud cost businesses a thousand times more. And that’s without mentioning Wirecard, the German Fintech that was famously exposed by the FT as a multibillion-dollar fraud.  

Power corrupts, and the ability to issue a currency then control its movement is the ultimate power. Put differently, the SWIFT message is mightier than the sword. The US has not invaded Iran or Venezuela, but crippled both countries with sanctions. Anyone concerned about the ESG impact of crypto should contemplate the social impact of policies that punish ordinary people for the crimes of the government that they are the greatest victims of.  

Crypto is by no means the cure-all that some claim, but it offers a check on the growing money madness. Populist politicians, overly zealous regulators, and trigger-happy central bankers — all of whom protect the increasingly problematic status quo — will now have to grapple with the presence of an egalitarian alternative. It’s not that everyone will eventually switch to crypto as their preferred type of money. It’s that the mere threat of doing so will keep the stewards of the traditional system honest. Whatever the environmental cost of this optionality, it is more than made up for by the social and governance benefits. ",0.112,0.754,0.134,0.9805

https://preview.redd.it/1ol141epy1h71.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14d12c67b26734728cd5b42d11be706d438f2404

**Large holders of Idiotcoins held a meeting to discuss the further investment strategy for the development of the cryptocurrency. The meeting was held online, in particular due to the Covid-19 pandemic.**

Major market players discussed issues related to brand development and increasing the liquidity of the crypto coin. The meeting was held at the site of the **Telegram channel** in compliance with all norms of social distancing.

The **new cryptocurrency** has rapidly gained popularity, and over the past 24 hours the number of its adherents has approached 500 people. Thus, the question arose about the further development of the brand. In the chat of idiots (as they call themselves), heated discussions began, and, despite the statement of the administrator, who claimed that he had created the coin solely for an experiment and was not pursuing attempts at enrichment, the rest of the idiots did not consider this statement sincere, although in itself an attempt to dodge from falling into the hands of wealth looks pretty idiotic, and therefore believable. After this statement by the creator of Idiotcoin, the coin’s quotes fell by several points. However, since the author of the coin later practically stayed away from the discussion, the number of idiotic ideas began to grow in arithmetic progression and the value of the coin on the crypto exchange quickly recovered and continued to grow further.

Summing up the results of a lengthy brainstorming session (if such a definition is generally appropriate for the communication of idiots), then several promising areas should be noted.

An idiotic claim has been made that idiotcoin is making history and needs to be immortalized with the release of the NTF. One of the major holders of the cryptocurrency said that he himself would acquire these dubious digital art objects and hang them on the wall at home as a commemorative sign. He also expressed the hope that the rest of the idiots will follow his example. Despite the fact that this idea is idiotic, or rather, as a result of this, such a proposal aroused great joy in the rest of the community.

No less idiotic is the proposal to attract tech giants as investors – Tesla, Apple, Amazon and others. Thus, idiots will receive investment, and investors will receive a humane way of influencing their workers. Indeed, in recent years it has become very difficult to influence negligent employees with the help of disciplinary actions. The number of lawsuits against employers is steadily growing, and trade unions do not allow managers to sleep peacefully. Rewarding a bad employee with idiotcoins is an opportunity for the employer to humanely and politically correctly express their opinion about the employee’s mental abilities. It turns out that this is a very affordable way to improve discipline and productivity in the company. Moreover, if such a measure does not take effect and the employee has to be fired, then the idiotcoin will serve him as an excellent severance pay.

Meanwhile, while there was a discussion of growth strategies, one of the major participants quietly sold cryptocurrency for about $ 450. This massive dumping of assets triggered the largest drop in the coin’s value of 30% in history. This became an unambiguous signal that this cryptocurrency is unreliable, and sane people should get rid of it immediately. It is not surprising that the idiots did not understand the signal, and if they did, they considered it a stress test and none of the idiotcoins’ holders began to get rid of their assets. On the contrary, idiots began to buy coins even more actively, and, probably, within a day, the idiotcoin will again renew its value record.  
Summarizing the above, in the near future we should expect the appearance of idiotic art objects on the NFT market. As for the reaction of tech giants to the intentions of idiotkon holders, official information has not yet been reported. Nevertheless, on the sidelines, they say that such cooperation is quite possible if the average number of idiots in these companies is not much lower than the world average.",0.062,0.828,0.11,0.9834

85,"French fund manager to launch first EU-regulated bitcoin tracker -  A French asset manager is set to launch an EU-regulated fund that closely tracks the price of bitcoin, marking one of the first times that investors will be able to access the hyper-volatile asset through mutual funds across the bloc.  

Paris-based Melanion Capital, a derivatives and computer-driven fund manager that has been expanding into digital assets, has recently received approval from the French regulator to launch an exchange traded fund that complies with the EU standards known as Ucits.  

The fund will track a basket of up to 30 stocks in sectors such as cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology, which Melanion says is up to 90 per cent correlated to the price of bitcoin.  

The launch highlights how fund firms are becoming increasingly creative in the face of financial regulators who are often sceptical or slow-moving when it comes to the fast-evolving world of digital assets.  

“I haven’t seen any funds launched yet that are focused on digital assets under the Ucits umbrella,” said Winston Penhall, a funds lawyer at Keystone Law in London. How regulators view bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is “all somewhat up in the air”, he added.  

Ucits funds, which are sold across the EU and are also popular in Asia and Latin America, are seen as an international gold standard of fund regulation. They form the bulk of European mutual funds and offer high levels of investor protections. But their rules were first established more than 30 years ago and do not directly address cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  

Most national regulators interpret the rules to mean digital assets cannot be directly held in funds, unless they are linked to listed securities. That makes it almost impossible to launch a Ucits fund investing predominantly in bitcoin that can be sold across the bloc and come with safeguards for consumers.  

“Most pipes of the traditional financial system stop at access to bitcoin,” said Melanion CEO Jad Comair. “The ETF was a real challenge because of the sensibilities and politics currently surrounding bitcoin and bitcoin investing.” 

Among the top holdings in Melanion’s index, which the fund will track and which is calculated by German fintech Bita, are stocks such as crypto miners Argo Blockchain and Riot Blockchain, investment management firm Galaxy Digital, led by entrepreneur Mike Novogratz, and broker Voyager Digital. Stocks are weighted based on how sensitive they are to movements in the bitcoin price. 

Ireland’s central bank last year said that it was “cognisant of both the important opportunities and material risks associated with crypto-assets”. However, EU regulator Esma noted in March this year that “some crypto assets are highly risky” and that most are unregulated in the EU.  

A number of exchange-traded notes and products that track bitcoin exist, such as the $242m Wisdom Bitcoin ETP. While they are regulated as securities, they do not have the coveted Ucits wrapper. 

In the US a range of fund firms, including Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest, have unveiled plans for bitcoin ETFs, although the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to grant approval.  

The French fund, called the Melanion BTC Equities Universe Ucits ETF, will be listed on Euronext in Paris and will charge a fee of 0.75 per cent.",0.021,0.881,0.099,0.9875

This makes sense even if you do trust them, as it would only trigger if snapped. - I see absolutely no argument against setting a stop loss at somewhere like 95c on Tether. Even if you believe the company really are authentic, the only way the valuation ever drops to below that point is because the Tether has snapped. If that happens redemption will no longer be possible due to a run on the bank, you could form a position below if the situation changed, and your potential losses would be limited to 5%.

If the Tether were ever to snap, whether due to panic selling, a run on the bank or a rug pull, it would happen INCREDIBLY quickly. Manual sell orders would be near impossible.

I remember a couple years back I was at the market one night trying to buy some milk for my kids. I stood before the milk section and saw dozens and dozens of brands and varieties. There was whole milk, 2%, non-fat, oat milk, almond milk, soy milk, sweetened, unsweetened, half gallon bottles, full gallon cartons, and everything in between. In that moment I was struck by the sheer number of choices before me. But it wasn't just the milk. You go to the bread section, the cereal section, the alcohol section, the ice cream section, and it's all the same. Choices upon choices upon choices. Maybe there are people in the world who think less choices are better, but I'm certainly not one of them.

​
There are billions of people on this planet, and we are all different, with different tastes, different backgrounds, and different desires. But the odds are that if one person desires something, that person isn't alone. On the flip side, not any one person will share all the desires of every person on the planet, so to believe that a single entity can plan the economy and optimize for everyone's wants and needs is either willful ignorance, or hubris.


This is why free markets are so essential. They allow anyone to introduce new ideas, services, and products to the rest of the world to determine if such innovations have value or not. This is also why our money is so important. It is the tool that allows markets to work efficiently, and the more efficient our money is, the more efficient our markets can be.

Every moment on this planet billions of people make countless choices as they go about their day. These choices combine to act as information that shapes the direction of humanity. Now imagine if those choices were already made for us. What if there was a single authority that told us what we can or can't watch, or read, or do, or who we can or can't hang out with, or what we can or can't talk about? Some argue such rules exist for everyone's best interest, but I believe that limiting our choices only limits our progress.

​

This goes well beyond just being able to drink the exact kind of milk you like. Imagine a central planning committee trying to come up with not only the different types of milk to satisfy everyone's wants, but all the other products, services, and technologies that exists today. It's laughable at best, and the only reason we are blessed with such variety and advanced technologies is through our collective imagination and ingenuity, and only insomuch as we are free to use both.

​

But back to the importance of money and its role in all of this. Money is not only what we use to pay for goods and services, it's also what we use to measure what we value. Much like words allow us to communicate and share ideas, money acts like a kind of language of its own. It's our way of communicating to the world at large what we want more, or less of, depending on how our money is being utilized.

​

But the system can't work properly if our money doesn't work properly. Imagine if a drug company ran a clinical trial, but instead of getting accurate data their results were skewed by the government printing trillions of false positives that made it appear as if the drug was behaving as intended. Similarly, by having to use money that can be manipulated in this way, it becomes more difficult to know what we really value and what we don't. In such a system the truth is ultimately distorted and can give unfair advantages to the undeserving rather than allow the free market to reward those who contribute the most value.

​

This is what excites me about crypto. I believe that crypto is effectively a free market for money itself. Each project is in competition with one another to see what the market values most. Just as the free market has given us the best products, it can give us the best money that offers the most utility and reliability while simultaneously rewarding those with the vision and the conviction to invest in the best projects. But I hope it doesn't end there. I want to see those who gain the most wealth to make use of their newfound capital to build a better society that aligns with the very values that put them in that position to begin with.


Of all the projects out there, I personally believe that cryptocurrency offers such an opportunity. Because we are all trying to solve the right problems, with some really solid roadmaps, and some of the most talented and experienced technical teams in all of the tech world.
 

I want to witness cryptocurrency become electronic cash that allows us to transact without being limited by national borders, or high transaction fees, all while giving us the ability to securely send any amount of money across the internet in fractions of a second without the need for banks or any other central authorities.

​

Everyone I have asked has not really been able to answer the benefits of it over traditional currency. Their interest and mine is mainly that it seems easier to acquire (and grow) than traditional currency at the moment.

Just a quick google search, the top hit from Investopedia.com (I know lol) gave some bullet points for the advantages of Bitcoin specifically, which tbh don’t really seem to be advantages. They were as follows:

1. User has autonomy: I can pay for stuff anonymously with cash or load a vanilla visa with cash if a card needs to be used
2. Transactions are pseudonyms: Same as above
3. Transactions are peer-to-peer: Feel like banking infrastructure would be more reliable for transfers and recovery in case of issues during transfer
4. Transactions don’t have banking fees or international fees: I don’t think I have ever incurred a bank fee. Most large banks have free wires, even internationally
5. Payments are mobile: Every reputable bank seems to have a mobile app at this point to use

134,"On the recent POLY hack. - Hello all, I'm a Cybersecurity Consultant who focuses on Digital Forensics and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence).


I know this situation is highly controversial, and thought people might find it interesting to hear about the perspective of someone involved in the field.


To start off, the term ""hacking"" is completely neutral. Hacking isn't illegal on its own, just as going into a house isn't illegal - what makes it illegal is when you're entering someone else's ""house"", without their permission. A good example of completely legal hacking is bug bounties: companies set up responsible disclosure programs (usually through platforms like intigriti or hackerone) which specify the assets you can test and what vulnerabilities you can test for.


Also, I'd like to make it clear that I **do not** advocate for blackhat testing of production/public assets Especially when it involves the assets of so many consumers. This is extremely irresponsible and nothing he does will change this fact.


*However.*


There *is* something to be said here about ignorant security architects and engineers. Despite being told repeatedly (allegedly) about critical vulnerabilities in the network, there was no true acknowledgement on the security team's part concerning the sheer amount of users who could be - and were - affected. 


This ignorance has led to the downfall of many companies' reputations. Equifax? Their IT team didn't feel like patching a critical vulnerability in Apache Struts, after being contacted by Gov't organizations 4. Separate. Times. This eventually led to the infamous data breach in 2017 that made Eauifax a laughing stock and case study in how not to run your information security team. 


Target? Shoddy configuration of their network led to the compromise of every POS system in stores that use Fazio AC units. Something as simple as *not running your POS systems on the same network as IoT machines that can be remotely accessed to manipulate devices on the same subnet* never crossed the minds of anyone in a governance or compliance position.


A very common factor between major integrity breaches is this: A loud minority of security engineers are a combination of incompetent, unreceptive to criticism, or unwilling to act on issues that *might* be a problem in favor of patching it when it becomes more ""important"" to management. 


/end rant


Regardless of why the security team didn't feel as if this were a major enough issue to triage immediately, it's obvious at this point what could have happened if a more malicious actor had exploited this vulnerability first. Forget giving anything back, nobody would see a dime and it'd likely all be unrecoverable. I'm not saying that what this guy did was a great thing, but it seems like he's making good on his promises to return the coins he took and was legitimately doing this to attract enough attention to keep this from happening in the future. 


Again, I'm not condoning what happened, but this could have been infinitely worse if the attacker wasn't as morally grounded. 



Tl;dr - hacker is irresponsible but imo is trying to bring light to an extremely important issue in cybersecurity (negligence of reported bugs/vulnerabilities), and is trying to prevent much larger losses in the future.",0.085,0.813,0.102,0.7003
