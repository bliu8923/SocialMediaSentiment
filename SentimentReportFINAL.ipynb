    "## Reddit Sentiment Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A look into the different data, models, and results I found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notable Findings:\n",
    "- There is NO correlation between reddit subreddits and the prices of cryptocurrencies. Even when sorted by the coin itself, there is no correlation found by Pearson's R, Kendall Tau, or Spearman rank. This means another factor is most likely the reason for price fluctuations that we see.\n",
    "- I also found that a lot of model calculations into positivity or negativity of certain statements were grossly incorrect. This proved to be much more true for a lot of 'investment lingo', such as \"to the moon\", \"HODL\", or \"FOMO\". This meant that a lot of statements that should have been extremely positive or negative ended up more neutral since the models trained had decided to make these words more neutral compared to pos or neg, meaning that a custom model might be the only method of making progress here.\n",
    "- I reached out to 5 redditors who claim to do sentiment analysis on certain subreddits concerning investments (r/wallstreetbets, r/CryptoCurrency, r/Bitcoin) and 4 reached out back. Their conclusions ultimately mirrored mine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin."

    "A few things we can notice with the new VADER model:\n",
    "- VADER still has trouble determining words like \"never\" and \"can't\" to invert certain sentiment values. This is a big problem especially when it comes to certain sentences that say \"never bullish\" or \"can't go to the moon\", which are interpreted positively. This is the biggest problem for accurate sentiment analysis.\n",
    "- Customizing the model actually flips certain posts making them positive instead of negative, which is actually extremely helpful for accuracy purposes.\n",
    "- Most changes, however, are extremely marginal in the scope of the entire sentiment analysis, which could mean that the posts were already accurate to begin with, there needs to be more custom words added to the model, or the average of the sentences in the posts are not a valid method of getting a total sentiment value.\n",
