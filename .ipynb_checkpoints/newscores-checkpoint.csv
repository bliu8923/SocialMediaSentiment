I needed to take some money to go spend in casino - real casino, not crypto and where I live at least it charges you a fee (which is bullshit in its own right) to use ATMs other than your primary bank. Okay, not a big deal, there are a few ATMs on my way home from work.

So I pull into the first one, drive thru since the main bank is still on reduced hours because of covid and NEITHER machine is dispensing any cash, but doesn't say why. I then drive around 5 minutes to the next one and same thing, the machine is out of cash or some shit and the bank itself is closed completely because of covid. I go to a third location which is actually an ATM located in a shop but an official BoA machine and there's some guy fixing machine because it broke and is having issues - no ETA.

I spent 45 minutes going to 3 different BoA ATMs and can't even get access to MY money because of your horseshit issues, ending up just going to a random one and eating the fees.

I‚Äôm realizing as I get better at investing that I need to build my stablecoin and DCA into that so I can have it readily available to buy into the coins I‚Äôm investing in when - ‚Äúblood is in the streets‚Äù, major dips happen to maximize my investment, not just when a ‚Äúdip‚Äù happens. 

So here is thought process and I would like some feedback/perspective/ideas how to make this better, or adapt and go in a different direction.

Currently - I have consolidated my Stablecoins to 2 sources - Crypto.com and Celsius 

Celsius is currently offering 8.8 APY on Stablecoins - very nice 

Crypto.com - in my case, I can earn 12% p.a. For locking 3 month term on USDC

I would like to take advantage of both, if possible. So here is what I‚Äôm trying to figure out - 

My thought process at the moment - is to lock like 60% in a 3 month term on crypto.com, 40% on Celsius as my principles -

They both payout weekly - crypto.com is simple interest, while Celsius is compounding, and I have the flexibility with Celsius to move those coins to an exchange and buy my investments when the market is good for buying - which is my endgame here

My idea is to rollover the interest earned from crypto.com and add it to my Celsius and let that add to my compounding. 

Originally I wasn‚Äôt going to bother with Crypto.com, however, I cannot not justify not taking advantage of that 12%.

9,"A wallet is not what you think it is - If you're new to the space, here is a quick 101 on wallets.

Metamask, Electrum, MEW, Trust, Coinomi, Atomic or whatever other application you call a wallet is not really a wallet.

They are **wallet applications** that allow you to access and manage your cryptocurrency, NFTs or whatever blockchain asset you have stored in your wallet.

**Your wallet is your private key or seed phrase.**

For example:

* You download Metamask
* It gives you the option to create a seed phrase/private key
* The same seed phrase you can import to other applications like Trust, MEW, Atomic and your ETH will be accessible on both Metamask and those applications.

So next time you download a new wallet application, you don't have to create a new seed phrase, you can just import the one you already have to manage your existing funds in both applications.

Just thought I'd share this since I work in crypto and I noticed that a lot of users don't know this.

EDIT: I felt obliged to add that this is the reason you should never ever share your private keys with anyone. Your keys are your sole access to your assets on the blockchain so keep them secure.

If you guys can see it then great. If not then here's a summary: 

""I was test driving the Shiba Inu DEX (Shibaswap) and it looked very well done to me. The interface was simple and inviting. The only thing I wished for were dumbed down instructions for people like my dad who were really excited to use the DEX for digging and burying (providing liquidity and staking respectively). Another thing thing that concerned me was the hype about it getting to one 1 cent. Im not hating on the project, I'm hating on this hype mentality.""

With the above summary of my previous post done I will pick up where I left off.

Interestingly enough, after converting half of my Dad's Shib to Bone to create a Bone/Shib pair I received SSLP tokens deposited onto my dad's wallet. I was expecting to receive rewards right away but a quick search on reddit told me that I needed to then deposit the SSLP tokens into the DEX (colloquially know as Woofing). Sure enough it was a success and my dad is now earning Bone at a rate of over 300%. Don't get me wrong, this is risky and I don't recommend this to anyone unless you know how to manage your risk. Also, I don't own any Shib myself. I was just helping my dad do his thing.

While I still think this is a long shot project (an ""experiment in decentralized community building"" as they call it) I like how fun they make the process of staking, swapping, providing liquidity, and redeeming earned rewards.

I certainly hope this isn't a rug pull for the sake of everyone invested. That being said, overall I like the project. I realize that there may be a lot of hate on here about Shiba and I've hated on it as well. As one commentator said in my previous post this community should be about bringing together open and civilized discussion between different crypto communities. So let's do that folks.

What I know for sure is that I'd really welcome a bear market. Sure, I'm truly sorry for all of those people who invested at ATHs, but I'm pretty sure that if they invested with a bit of common sense they will recover and everything will be alright. As for me, I'm going to accumulate as much as I can now that I've grown up and I have a job - unlike in the crash of 2018.  


Speaking of 2017-2018, that was the first time I got in contact with crypto thanks to a university friend, and I even invested a little bit of money - by the way, that little bit of money back then was enough to buy 5 ETH...  
Anyway, when the market crashed I panic sold and I often feel stupid about it. Now it will take a lot of time to accumulate those 5 ETH that I bought for like 500$ at that time! But I am still on time, we are still on time to change our future and welcome the next bear market as an opportunity instead of being frightened by it. I am going to save 20% of my salary to invest it on ETH and I am sure this will give me great returns some day. I really want to learn from my mistakes, it's only human nature to make mistakes, I don't think there's anyone who bought BTC at 10$ and was already experienced enough to hold it throughout all the various crashes of BTC's history.

31,"üëÅ Oracle Solutions for Dummies üëÅ - Cryptocurrency price valuation fluctuates rapidly, it's why we love it. But in such a new, wild-west-like environment, there are many factors that can effect any given assets price, such as;  leverage, arbitrage, whales, FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt), retail/institutional buying and selling. The list goes on. How do you really know what the actual value of an asset is at any given time when there are so many different factors at play? Furthermore, how do you know the exchange you purchase your crypto from is giving you the most accurate, up to date price feed for the asset you want to purchase? 

üëÅOracle Solutions üëÅ

An oracle solution is essentially the ""all seeing eye"" for all partnered assets current price/activity feed. The oracle gives that information to all partnered exchanges/DEX's (decentralized exchanges) so there is little of a discrepancy possible between prices amongst buying platforms. Reducing arbitrage and stabilizing the fungibility of an asset.

Without a strong oracle solution bringing the most up to date, real time prices possible, assets would be disproportionate to one another amongst exchanges, along with being nearly impossible to truly evaluate the current state of an asset.

Examples of üëÅOracle Solutions üëÅ

\-Chainlink

\-Aurgur

\-Band Protocol

\-MakerDao

\*Extra Info\*

Chainlink is currently working on developing an NFT oracle solution. One of which I am personally very excited about. As far as my knowledge goes, they are the only platform working on developing one specifically for NFTs. It's incredibly hard to actually know a fair price for any given collectible. The true valuation of an NFT is whatever two parties are willing to sell/pay for it. You may be thinking, ""how is that any different from any other asset?"". Simply put, Fungibility. My bitcoin will always be the same price as your bitcoin, but a 1 of 1 NFT? Who makes that price.... Chainlink is working on a way to keep up to date tabs on NFT sales around the blockchain to see what other NFT's are selling for with similar qualities such as; minting, time of release, licensing , etc. To give users as accurate of a valuation as possible to what their NFT is worth!

That is undoubtedly true, that's an impressive affiliation, but there are a variety of different teaching affiliations with colleges. Harvard, for example, includes lecturers who are not tenured faculty. This isn't to say they aren't impressive, but it's not the same as a full professor. 

On to Micali. The academic resume is, in fact, quite impressive. He's earned several national and international awards in computing, most significantly the Turing Award. He is a full professor at MIT which is incredibly impressive, that immediately puts him in the most prestigious rank of professors at one of the country's most impressive universities. The impact of academics is often evaluated based on the wide application of research, Micali certainly has research applied far and wide. His peer-reviewed articles [average 75 citations each](https://dl.acm.org/profile/81100228636), with a total of over 11,000 citations. Simply put, he is an academic heavyweight. His work is impactful, he occupies a prestigious professorship, and is regularly cited.

None of this is to shill ALGO (full disclosure, i do hold some but not a ton). Academic qualifications don't mean guaranteed success, it may not be correlated with success at all.

41,"Polkadot seems undervalued [key metric analysis] - I am fairly new to cryptocurrency (started investing in May 2021) so I have been deep in market research mode trying to figure out which coins/tokens may be worth accumulating over time. Polkadot really stands out to me as a project that seems to have a lot of upside at current prices, so I thought I would lay the case out on this thread in order to stimulate some conversation and see where the blind spots may be. **None of this is financial advice, of course.** Just a random person's opinion on where things are at the moment.

**What is Polkadot?** 

Per [Coinbase.com](https://Coinbase.com), *Polkadot is a protocol that enables cross-blockchain transfers of any type of data or asset. By uniting multiple blockchains, Polkadot aims to achieve high degrees of security and scalability. DOT serves as the protocol's governance token and can be used for staking to secure the network or to connect (""bond"") new chains*. Since this is not intended to be a Polkadot summary, if you want to dig deeper check out the [Polkadot website](https://polkadot.network/), [Messari profile](https://messari.io/asset/polkadot/profile), [light paper](https://polkadot.network/Polkadot-lightpaper.pdf), and/or [white paper](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf).

**Key metrics on Polkadot**

1. **Several market indicators show Polkadot is undervalued.** Polkadot is currently trading below $13, which is almost 50% below its 200 day exponential moving average of over $22. This compares favorably to BTC (20% below 200 day), ETH (4% down), and ADA (7% up). It's also 12% below the Moving Average Convergence Divergence trendline, which is more than most other high cap coins I'm checking. Finally, it's below 1 on the Moving Value to Realized Value ratio, which is assumed to be a buy sign. Did I cherry pick some of these metrics? Sort of... though they seem to be some of the most common market metrics and all look relatively favorable here.
2. **On chain metrics have shown growth even during the downturn.** Active addresses (30 day MA) are up 80%, transactions are up 117% (30 day MA), and transaction volume is up 33% (30 day MA) per [coinmetrics.io](https://coinmetrics.io). People are using the network, which is awesome considering that parachains haven't even officially launched.
3. **Polkadot has the second most robust active developer community**, per [Electric Capital](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444). They apparently have \~400 active developers working on various projects, up 100% in the last 12 months. This is well behind Ethereum, of course, but I think it's a very good sign, especially for a network that hasn't even officially launched [parachain auctions](https://parachains.info/) yet. There are also some really high profile projects building exclusively on Polkadot, including Acala Network.
4. **""Smart money"" loves Polkadot**. It looks like Polkadot has considerable investment from venture capitalists to-date. $277 million votes of confidence if information on [Messari.io](https://Messari.io) is accurate. I also love to see that several VCs have set up dedicated Polkadot ecosystem funds, including Polychain Capital and Digital Finance Group. While some may argue that less VC involvement is better for decentralization, I want to invest in blockchains that will be around for years to come, and this level of involvement gives me confidence that will be the case here, bull or bear market.
5. **Polkadot is building something unique.** There are a lot of projects out there promising smart contracts, low transaction costs and high throughput. What I appreciate about Polkadot is that they are building a blockchain ecosystem that is not only secure and scalable (and hopefully more decentralized than it is now) but is designed to be more than the sum of its parts. Intentional interoperability. And, judging by the excitement among developers and VCs, I have no reason to believe this vision won't work out. 

No project is perfect, and I try to be honest about downside risks and/or project weaknesses. Some of those include, but may not be limited to:

1. **Polkadot is more centralized and private investor focused than other projects**. \~70% of DOT is housed in the Top 100 addresses compared to 40% for Ethereum and 21% for Cardano. Furthermore, only 22% of tokens were sold to public investors which arguably poses a headwind for long-term community development. Polkadot certainly doesn't have an army of advocates like Cardano or Ethereum seem to have.
2. **Polkadot is still in development**. The project appears to be on track in many respects, but we won't really know how the ecosystem functions until parachain auctions get underway and projects launch on the mainnet.

Overall, I believe that the project offers much more to be excited about than nervous about. Yet the price is off 48% over the last month and over 75% from its ATH.

50,"The Flippening, ETH and BTC - Hi everyone, 

Let me start by saying that I do not mean to throw any shade on Bitcoin. I love it, am personally invested, and believe that it has changed the world for a better. Next, this is obviously no financial advice - I'm just interested in having a discussion. 

What this is about: I am a little worried about Bitcoins future and would love to hear your opinions on this. 

If the flippening really does happen and Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin in terms of Marketcap, where will that leave BTC? 

I believe that much of BTCs appeal stems from the fact that it is the first major cryptocurrency but also the largest cryptocurrency in the world. Most investors default to investing in BTC because of its legacy and its size - perhaps aiming to limit some volatility in the process. But what if the Flippening and the resulting Media coverage repaint ETH as the figurehead? 

Combine this with the FUD and shade Bitcoin has received in the past months through some very famous internet people - I am starting to be pessimistic. I worry about panicsales of BTC. 

Yes, BTC aims to serve as a store of value, but for many people, this actually means an 'increase of value over time', as evidenced by the dismay about the current crab market. As BTC (currently) has little other application that I know of, I'm worried that BTC might not reach many new ATHs anymore. 


What do you think? 


TLDR: If ETH replaces BTC as crypto figurehead/top crypto - commonly referred to as ""The Flippening"", how bad will that be for BTCs future?",0.092,0.838,0.07,-0.7666
51,"How the Fed printing money is driving equities price increase and is good for crypto - in the short term - I am not a financial advisor and bearly a nocive student of economics.

The Fed uses its policy lever of printing money to stimulate the economy.  The printed money is dominantly used to issue low-interest rate loans to Wallstreet or to buy up their at-risk positions to prevent them from defaulting. What this equals is a market where companies are flush with cash and buying back their own stocks to drive up the prices all while being able to borrow at record low rates to buy other risky investments as well.  Companies and individuals flock toward risky investments (like crypto) seeking high returns as this fed policy has also caused low return rates on traditional investments.  Fed policy is driving up stock prices, Fed policy is forcing people toward crypto.  Eventually, the merry-go-round will stop as the Fed will eventually have to change policy and start increasing interest rates.  Wallstreet won't be in a position to borrow cheaply from the Fed anymore and won't be in a cash-flush position to buy their own stock back anymore and the market will throw a tantrum (a taper tantrum).  

TLDR:  Fed fiscal policy is driving people toward high-risk investments seeking a return,  fed policy is good for crypto.  You should consider holding your assets in equities like stocks or crypto to ride the benefits of Fed policy instead of fighting the Fed.",0.066,0.837,0.097,0.765

So With this news.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/650-u.s.-community-banks-can-now-offer-crypto-services-2021-07-01](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/650-u.s.-community-banks-can-now-offer-crypto-services-2021-07-01)

The banks are not going to give you a wallet for this crypto, which means, you have to trust the bank that they actually bought and are holding your crypto. And at we know in the states, fractural reserve banking is gone, they may have capital requirements(They must have some random asset to support the deposits) so they don't have to back your your deposits with what you actually deposited with. So what are the chances, they don't have to back up your crypto with well, crypto.

This means your crypto purchases with a bank, are most likely a fancy IOU. (There may be a small amount the bank is actually holding in crypto)

So I foresee a potential problem with this, is that its possible that the amount of money eventually invested in lets say BTC will far exceed the value of BTC, because well... people didn't actually buy and hold it, just a got a pegged value from their bank.

When you actually get your hands on a real portion of BTC, you literally taken it, and held it so it cannot be traded, reducing the overall trading supply. *If you are hoping for BTC to go up in value, you want it held off exchange/bank custodianship.*

For Example. If banks are only buying a small percentage to back your crypto purchase. If you buy 1 BTC with the bank, and they only buy .1 BTC to ""reserve it"" That means you've let .9 BTC still be traded and can bring down the value.

**Not your keys, not your coins.**

So in other news...

[https://www.financegates.net/2021/07/06/sygnum-becomes-first-bank-to-offer-ethereum-staking/](https://www.financegates.net/2021/07/06/sygnum-becomes-first-bank-to-offer-ethereum-staking/)

Banks in Europe are starting to offer ETH 2.0 staking... Can you guess my problem with that?

(Basing this off of the speculation that ETH 2.0 will work with a delegation pool system)

But what else... What else occurs with staking coins typically. YOUR VOTE.

Depending on the pool you stake you, typically you choose ones that will vote, how you would like? No? (Unless you get a governance token, depending on the style of POS)

I bet you anything, staking with a Bank, they are not gonna give you your vote. or you've given your vote to them.

Now lets says they do 1:1 stake for you, And they actually bought 100% real Ethereum for you. and they stake it. You dont have your vote, which means over time. We will give all voting power to the banks.

**Banks could control Ethereum. Which means the government will control Ethereum.**

As a side note for consideration for ETH becoming deflationary. The value will go up. As it gets higher and higher, it will be harder and harder to buy voting power.

Let's say I bought ADA at 2.00 and I spent $5000 (2500 ADA). Now with the current price of let's say 1.20 my position is worth $3000. If I were to sell my original position and buy back at $1.20 I would still have 2500 ADA but I would have realized a $2000 loss. Now personally in the long term, I expect the price of ADA to go higher, and that my original position will eventually go back into profit.  And I also understand that by selling and rebuying lower that when the price returns to $2.00 I would be back to a net 0, but I can't seem to shake the idea that repositioning at a lower price for the same amount of  ADA isn't a bad idea but I also don't necessarily see an advantage. Is there some kind of advantage of doing something like this? Maybe lowering my average buy price across multiple entries? or maybe there's some kind of tax advantage?

Quality content creators, video artists, photographers, painters, artists etc. have pretty much nothing to gain except that old ""exposure"", which amounts to basically nothing and is very minimal if you're not trying to monetize your channel in some way and pulling all kinds of tricks to try to get people to see your work.

And what kind of system do you think would work the best in that kind of platform, what changes would be need to be implemented for it to work? Im not a user for the time being, the photo quality is crap and optimized to mobile, (ie. desktop quality that looks great on an 32"" 4K display always looks like crap), the interface is that ""good old"" fb style where it is designed to work on cell phones only, trying to get users hooked for worthless likes &amp; them trying their best to get all users to install it to their phones.

Also, are there any good alternatives at the moment that come to mind that provide a better service with good interactions to the content creators and users with said improvement already in place.

139,"Taxes: If I bought at the high, then swap for another coin after everything crashes 50%, but then HODL that new coin for years, does the swap count as a loss? - Let's say I bought $500 of BTC I May 1st

Then kaboom.

Then I swap 100% of that BTC for ETH, worth now only $200. (made up numbers) in June.

Canada says any coin trades are taxable events. So, does that mean I just lost $300 in the eyes of the taxman?

Now fast forward to April (tax season) and ETH rockets to $10k, my eth is worth $2000 (again, exact math not important).. But I DON'T sell it...

The tax man can't say I made $1800, as I haven't initiated a new taxable event.

If this is true, then I have a crazy idea. When you're at the dangerous top of a market and you're pretty sure another May Crash will happen (where the entire market comes down), LOAD UP on an Alt coin and then swap it at the bottom for a bellwether like BTC or ETH that will CERTAINLY go up. Be sure the Alt isn't pure garbage so that the decline is similar to BTC, otherwise you won't gain as much back. By doing this, depending how much you buy, you could use Crypto to claim HUGR tax breaks because of your ""loss"".

4. Address code will pop up on celesti.trade Copy that address.

5. Open your vault on reddit app/pc and then click on send moons option.

6. Paste the address and select moon you want to send and click send.

7. It would hardly take a min to get it deposited I your wallet.


You can sell XLM for USD or your native currency.

The NFT capabilities showed of by hinse make me imagine some cards similar to that of the wizard ones in Harry Potter, with the tems (Pokemon) moving around etc!

145,"Don't underestimate US child tax credit payments and retail money. - There's around 23.5 million children under 6 in the US. Yesterday, the government paid the parents the first monthly child tax credit payment of $300 each.

There's about 50 million aged 6-17. Each of those was a credit payment of $250.

The past 18 months have been a shit time to have kids, but that doesn't mean a majority of the country has just sat around and waited for government checks. Many people with kids already made sacrifices, changed jobs around, downsized, or found some other way to be sustainable, because that's what you do as a parent.

Now this is $250-$300 per kid for almost every parent in the country, and to many like me, it was ""I'll believe it when I see it"" money. I don't need this right now. You know where it's going? Into crypto.

There's millions of other parents out there to whom this is too little too late from a government that left us hanging last year, so we'll take that money, like we are any extra money, and find ways to grow it.

Hype fades, and memes will always change with time, nothing in the universe is guaranteed, but some positive things can be taken out of it.

Now, you know about and have invested into crypto, but dont let your poor decisions about what asset you should invest cloud your julgament on what to do next.

Guess what? Big Banks, institutions and even governments, are having meetings to discuss the possibilites of investing heavily into bitcoin and ethereum, there are not having this reunions to invest into dogecoin.

Follow smart and big money and in a few years you might be sitting on a honey pot because you decided to broad your horizons and think like the big boys at the table.

You dont need to be a trading machine or a investment goat to realize what kinda of opportunity you have been presented with.

The path is very simple, buy bitcoin and ethereum on a weekly or monthly basis with the little remaining fiat that you have after you pay your bills. One good thing about crypto is that you can invest as little as you want without no entry barrier, like the stock markets where you need to acquire at least 100 stocks.

New disruptive technology always take time to be fully developed and we could be sitting in the early future of finances here without even fully knowing it , and you know what could happen in some years from now? That little money you invested is now worth 100x of what initially was. 

If you made all the way to here, I just want to know that even though we may seem as an individualist community with our favourite coins, one thing is certain, we are stronger when we are united.
