# SocialMediaCryptoSentiment
 Using Different Models to predict Sentiment of Crypto Social Media Posts

 Currently, there are 3 notebooks in this repo, one extremely technical and the others are more for presentation.
 
### Reddit EDA
 This notebook does some very basic EDA on the base VADER model used on reddit data. Currently splits by category,
number of comments, and length of post.

### SentimentReportFINAL
 This notebook describes how the VADER model was executed and edited on Reddit posts from r/CryptoCurrency. Will add 
splitting by coin at a later date.

### FunctionTesting
 This notebook was used to test different models and their functions, ignore this one due to lack of explanation and
 lack of direction
