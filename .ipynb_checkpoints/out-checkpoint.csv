But in such a new, wild-west-like environment, there are many factors that can effect any given assets price, such as;  leverage, arbitrage, whales, FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt), retail/institutional buying and selling. The list goes on. How do you really know what the actual value of an asset is at any given time when there are so many different factors at play? Furthermore, how do you know the exchange you purchase your crypto from is giving you the most accurate, up to date price feed for the asset you want to purchase? 

üëÅOracle Solutions üëÅ

An oracle solution is essentially the ""all seeing eye"" for all partnered assets current price/activity feed. The oracle gives that information to all partnered exchanges/DEX's (decentralized exchanges) so there is little of a discrepancy possible between prices amongst buying platforms. Reducing arbitrage and stabilizing the fungibility of an asset.

Without a strong oracle solution bringing the most up to date, real time prices possible, assets would be disproportionate to one another amongst exchanges, along with being nearly impossible to truly evaluate the current state of an asset.

\*Extra Info\*

Chainlink is currently working on developing an NFT oracle solution. One of which I am personally very excited about. As far as my knowledge goes, they are the only platform working on developing one specifically for NFTs. It's incredibly hard to actually know a fair price for any given collectible. The true valuation of an NFT is whatever two parties are willing to sell/pay for it. You may be thinking, ""how is that any different from any other asset?"". Simply put, Fungibility. My bitcoin will always be the same price as your bitcoin, but a 1 of 1 NFT? Who makes that price.... Chainlink is working on a way to keep up to date tabs on NFT sales around the blockchain to see what other NFT's are selling for with similar qualities such as; minting, time of release, licensing , etc. To give users as accurate of a valuation as possible to what their NFT is worth!

That is undoubtedly true, that's an impressive affiliation, but there are a variety of different teaching affiliations with colleges. Harvard, for example, includes lecturers who are not tenured faculty. This isn't to say they aren't impressive, but it's not the same as a full professor. 

On to Micali. The academic resume is, in fact, quite impressive. He's earned several national and international awards in computing, most significantly the Turing Award. He is a full professor at MIT which is incredibly impressive, that immediately puts him in the most prestigious rank of professors at one of the country's most impressive universities. The impact of academics is often evaluated based on the wide application of research, Micali certainly has research applied far and wide. His peer-reviewed articles [average 75 citations each](https://dl.acm.org/profile/81100228636), with a total of over 11,000 citations. Simply put, he is an academic heavyweight. His work is impactful, he occupies a prestigious professorship, and is regularly cited.

None of this is to shill ALGO (full disclosure, i do hold some but not a ton). Academic qualifications don't mean guaranteed success, it may not be correlated with success at all.

galensmith,1626469208.0,olpxi3,1.0,METRICS,1.0,,1.0,"I am fairly new to cryptocurrency (started investing in May 2021) so I have been deep in market research mode trying to figure out which coins/tokens may be worth accumulating over time. Polkadot really stands out to me as a project that seems to have a lot of upside at current prices, so I thought I would lay the case out on this thread in order to stimulate some conversation and see where the blind spots may be. **None of this is financial advice, of course.** Just a random person's opinion on where things are at the moment.

**What is Polkadot?** 

Per [Coinbase.com](https://Coinbase.com), *Polkadot is a protocol that enables cross-blockchain transfers of any type of data or asset. By uniting multiple blockchains, Polkadot aims to achieve high degrees of security and scalability. DOT serves as the protocol's governance token and can be used for staking to secure the network or to connect (""bond"") new chains*. Since this is not intended to be a Polkadot summary, if you want to dig deeper check out the [Polkadot website](https://polkadot.network/), [Messari profile](https://messari.io/asset/polkadot/profile), [light paper](https://polkadot.network/Polkadot-lightpaper.pdf), and/or [white paper](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf).

**Key metrics on Polkadot**

1. **Several market indicators show Polkadot is undervalued.** Polkadot is currently trading below $13, which is almost 50% below its 200 day exponential moving average of over $22. This compares favorably to BTC (20% below 200 day), ETH (4% down), and ADA (7% up). It's also 12% below the Moving Average Convergence Divergence trendline, which is more than most other high cap coins I'm checking. Finally, it's below 1 on the Moving Value to Realized Value ratio, which is assumed to be a buy sign. Did I cherry pick some of these metrics? Sort of... though they seem to be some of the most common market metrics and all look relatively favorable here.
2. **On chain metrics have shown growth even during the downturn.** Active addresses (30 day MA) are up 80%, transactions are up 117% (30 day MA), and transaction volume is up 33% (30 day MA) per [coinmetrics.io](https://coinmetrics.io). People are using the network, which is awesome considering that parachains haven't even officially launched.
3. **Polkadot has the second most robust active developer community**, per [Electric Capital](https://medium.com/electric-capital/electric-capital-developer-report-2020-9417165c6444). They apparently have \~400 active developers working on various projects, up 100% in the last 12 months. This is well behind Ethereum, of course, but I think it's a very good sign, especially for a network that hasn't even officially launched [parachain auctions](https://parachains.info/) yet. There are also some really high profile projects building exclusively on Polkadot, including Acala Network.
4. **""Smart money"" loves Polkadot**. It looks like Polkadot has considerable investment from venture capitalists to-date. $277 million votes of confidence if information on [Messari.io](https://Messari.io) is accurate. I also love to see that several VCs have set up dedicated Polkadot ecosystem funds, including Polychain Capital and Digital Finance Group. While some may argue that less VC involvement is better for decentralization, I want to invest in blockchains that will be around for years to come, and this level of involvement gives me confidence that will be the case here, bull or bear market.
5. **Polkadot is building something unique.** There are a lot of projects out there promising smart contracts, low transaction costs and high throughput. What I appreciate about Polkadot is that they are building a blockchain ecosystem that is not only secure and scalable (and hopefully more decentralized than it is now) but is designed to be more than the sum of its parts. Intentional interoperability. And, judging by the excitement among developers and VCs, I have no reason to believe this vision won't work out. 

No project is perfect, and I try to be honest about downside risks and/or project weaknesses. Some of those include, but may not be limited to:

1. **Polkadot is more centralized and private investor focused than other projects**. \~70% of DOT is housed in the Top 100 addresses compared to 40% for Ethereum and 21% for Cardano. Furthermore, only 22% of tokens were sold to public investors which arguably poses a headwind for long-term community development. Polkadot certainly doesn't have an army of advocates like Cardano or Ethereum seem to have.
2. **Polkadot is still in development**. The project appears to be on track in many respects, but we won't really know how the ecosystem functions until parachain auctions get underway and projects launch on the mainnet.

Overall, I believe that the project offers much more to be excited about than nervous about. Yet the price is off 48% over the last month and over 75% from its ATH. This seems like an overcorrection to me, especially when you consider that parachain auctions are right around the corner which could offer up a steady drip of bullish news.

Notyourregularthrow,1626468265.0,olpn0b,1.0,STRATEGY,0.0,,1.0,"Hi everyone, 

Let me start by saying that I do not mean to throw any shade on Bitcoin. I love it, am personally invested, and believe that it has changed the world for a better. Next, this is obviously no financial advice - I'm just interested in having a discussion. 

What this is about: I am a little worried about Bitcoins future and would love to hear your opinions on this. 

If the flippening really does happen and Ethereum overtakes Bitcoin in terms of Marketcap, where will that leave BTC? 

I believe that much of BTCs appeal stems from the fact that it is the first major cryptocurrency but also the largest cryptocurrency in the world. Most investors default to investing in BTC because of its legacy and its size - perhaps aiming to limit some volatility in the process. But what if the Flippening and the resulting Media coverage repaint ETH as the figurehead? 

Combine this with the FUD and shade Bitcoin has received in the past months through some very famous internet people - I am starting to be pessimistic. I worry about panicsales of BTC. 

Yes, BTC aims to serve as a store of value, but for many people, this actually means an 'increase of value over time', as evidenced by the dismay about the current crab market. As BTC (currently) has little other application that I know of, I'm worried that BTC might not reach many new ATHs anymore. 


What do you think?

The Fed uses its policy lever of printing money to stimulate the economy.  The printed money is dominantly used to issue low-interest rate loans to Wallstreet or to buy up their at-risk positions to prevent them from defaulting. What this equals is a market where companies are flush with cash and buying back their own stocks to drive up the prices all while being able to borrow at record low rates to buy other risky investments as well.  Companies and individuals flock toward risky investments (like crypto) seeking high returns as this fed policy has also caused low return rates on traditional investments.  Fed policy is driving up stock prices, Fed policy is forcing people toward crypto.  Eventually, the merry-go-round will stop as the Fed will eventually have to change policy and start increasing interest rates.  Wallstreet won't be in a position to borrow cheaply from the Fed anymore and won't be in a cash-flush position to buy their own stock back anymore and the market will throw a tantrum (a taper tantrum).

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/650-u.s.-community-banks-can-now-offer-crypto-services-2021-07-01](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/650-u.s.-community-banks-can-now-offer-crypto-services-2021-07-01)

The banks are not going to give you a wallet for this crypto, which means, you have to trust the bank that they actually bought and are holding your crypto. And at we know in the states, fractural reserve banking is gone, they may have capital requirements(They must have some random asset to support the deposits) so they don't have to back your your deposits with what you actually deposited with. So what are the chances, they don't have to back up your crypto with well, crypto.

This means your crypto purchases with a bank, are most likely a fancy IOU. (There may be a small amount the bank is actually holding in crypto)

So I foresee a potential problem with this, is that its possible that the amount of money eventually invested in lets say BTC will far exceed the value of BTC, because well... people didn't actually buy and hold it, just a got a pegged value from their bank.

When you actually get your hands on a real portion of BTC, you literally taken it, and held it so it cannot be traded, reducing the overall trading supply. *If you are hoping for BTC to go up in value, you want it held off exchange/bank custodianship.*

For Example. If banks are only buying a small percentage to back your crypto purchase. If you buy 1 BTC with the bank, and they only buy .1 BTC to ""reserve it"" That means you've let .9 BTC still be traded and can bring down the value.

**Not your keys, not your coins.**

Banks in Europe are starting to offer ETH 2.0 staking... Can you guess my problem with that?

(Basing this off of the speculation that ETH 2.0 will work with a delegation pool system)

But what else... What else occurs with staking coins typically. YOUR VOTE.

Depending on the pool you stake you, typically you choose ones that will vote, how you would like? No? (Unless you get a governance token, depending on the style of POS)

I bet you anything, staking with a Bank, they are not gonna give you your vote. or you've given your vote to them.

Now lets says they do 1:1 stake for you, And they actually bought 100% real Ethereum for you. and they stake it. You dont have your vote, which means over time. We will give all voting power to the banks.

**Banks could control Ethereum. Which means the government will control Ethereum.**

As a side note for consideration for ETH becoming deflationary. The value will go up. As it gets higher and higher, it will be harder and harder to buy voting power.

You are buying a technology in it's early stages and it generally moves up. If you are not a total idiot and invest what you can afford to lose, you surely can wait a couple of years for the price to rebound into the green again. Assuming that you invested in a proper project and not a memecoin or shitcoin.

What I'm getting at here is that, yes the price may temporarily go down (even 80%) but if you are patient enough you will get nice profits. This is an investment and it should be treated as such. You don't see businesses invest in something for 2 months but rather for 5+ years. Why shouldn't you do the same?

* XRP will win or settle their lawsuit against SEC
* The stock market is rolling and will continue to do so for a while.

Let's say I bought ADA at 2.00 and I spent $5000 (2500 ADA). Now with the current price of let's say 1.20 my position is worth $3000. If I were to sell my original position and buy back at $1.20 I would still have 2500 ADA but I would have realized a $2000 loss. Now personally in the long term, I expect the price of ADA to go higher, and that my original position will eventually go back into profit.  And I also understand that by selling and rebuying lower that when the price returns to $2.00 I would be back to a net 0, but I can't seem to shake the idea that repositioning at a lower price for the same amount of  ADA isn't a bad idea but I also don't necessarily see an advantage. Is there some kind of advantage of doing something like this? Maybe lowering my average buy price across multiple entries? or maybe there's some kind of tax advantage?

neonreplica,1626465809.0,olotp1,1.0,EXCHANGE,1.0,,1.0," So I am considering re-allocating some more of my portfolio to crypto and have two ways of doing so:

* A) Selling investments in my non-registered account and buying crypto directly
* B) Selling investments in my registered\* account and buying crypto indirectly via BTC and ETH ETFs.
* \*my registered account is tax-sheltered from capital gains, and is within my account at a major bank in my country.

At first glance, option B seems like the best move: I don't incur capital gains on the sell step, and any gains would be tax-sheltered (with option A being the opposite). However, the only thing that is bothering me about option B is that I won't hold the crypto directly. Up until now, I've been buying crypto directly and holding it in on a Ledger. I'm well aware of the ""not-your-keys-not-your-crypto"" rule, and option B would be the first time I deviate from it.

Am I overly paranoid about not holding the crypto directly? I'm considering buying Purpose's BTCC.B and ETHH.B. They claim to hold the coins with Gemini and to have insurance.

Also are there any other drawbacks to holding the ETFS? I'm not very familiar with what Purpose could do to devalue the ETF, like issue more shares, etc.

Now, you know about and have invested into crypto, but dont let your poor decisions about what asset you should invest cloud your julgament on what to do next.

You dont need to be a trading machine or a investment goat to realize what kinda of opportunity you have been presented with.

The path is very simple, buy bitcoin and ethereum on a weekly or monthly basis with the little remaining fiat that you have after you pay your bills.

Pressure is now coming for them to be involved in this space from their wealthy clients. Whatever people really thing of crypto, they still succumb to greed and their own fear of missing out.

The only issue is I have no idea where the Linux ARM support for crypto wallets is even at. Google searching isn't helping with that question--unless the answer is ""nothing.""

Has anyone done something like this? Any advice? I hear that Daedalus is the most reliable/secure/future-proof option, but it doesn't seem to support ARM architecture at all.

I've only been in the crypto space for about 5 months and am still learning to analyze crypto but there are a few immediate red flags. Coinbase doesn't list a market cap or a circulating supply. The coin is currently reported at 83% buy to 17% sell and is -78% over last 24 hr. The coin has only been around since APRIL and is DOWN 98% from ATH (which was launch). Coinbase has an ""about"" section but my frontal lobe isn't nearly large enough to understand what words like ""interoperability"" mean or whether the project has any promise. I know that sometimes the projects with the most promise can have the most disappointing performance but unless Coinbase's information is wrong CLV is looking a lot like ICP. I know Coinbase announced recently that it wants to list everything it legally can but it seems like there are better projects they could support with their platform. 

That being said, I have a small lizard brain and may be missing something about his project. Feel free to correct me.",Thoughts on CLV on Coinbase?,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/olmrnn/thoughts_on_clv_on_coinbase/

Some days I'd fantasize about how I'm so smart for investing in Crypto that I will retire by the end of the year.

Like most, I got sucked in by all the hype posts. ""XXX coin will be $10 EOY for sure"".....based on what exactly? Did I care? No, I just aped in and felt like a king when I was up 200% in a week.

And now, like most, I am bored of crypto. I've stopped watching videos and reading posts and looking for the next big thing, but unlike most, I am HODLing.

My plan is to HODL until I am a millionaire. This may take 7 years, it may take 17 years or 27 years. Either way, I'm HODLing because I have only invested money I can lose and do not need to sell, ever.....until ¬£1,000,000

This drop in the market has made it easier to HODL because it's made me bored of it all. Now, I just buy and leave it. Simple. No emotions. No waiting for the dip. No timing the peak to take profits. Just buy, stake, HODL.

If you're not bored yet, get bored so you can enjoy your life. Check back in a few years to see if you can retire early or if you need to keep HODLing a bit longer.

Both Bitcoin and the Doge communities are being used

Serious

After some investigation it appears that some heavy hitter banks and hedge fund managers shorted tesla as far back as December, since tesla was less than 200 back in august and at 600 or so in December they thought it was a safe bet. Unfortunately Tesla stayed up.

Then Tesla accepts Bitcoin- elon loves all crypto- the banks and hedge funds take advantage and start buying bitcoin and bundling with mutual funds Very risky- The banks and fund managers drive the price of bit up to record levels. Even though bundling any crypto is a huge risk- but hey it was our retirements not theirs

Tesla stock still not going down, Then the media starts beating on the story about fossil fuels and bitcoin some 4 - five weeks ago. Tesla is a green brand- Tesla investigates and finds out its true- Tesla has not choice but to suspend bitcoin until Bitcoin fixes it.

Then walks in Barry from coindesk, the juvenile fanboy war starts between the communities and he will short doge and wants everyone to buy bitcoin- Banks and fund managers are loving it, anything to affect tesla stock,

Then you have Petey also from coindesk, picking a fanboy war complete with name calling- While Elon who has also pointed out deficiencies in Doge (however doge welcomed the input and the doge devs went to work on solutions) , pointed out some of Bitcoins issues. Instead of welcoming the input and working towards solutions, Petey, gets the BIt community to wage war.

Petey then tells his community how to short tesla.... Seems interesting- Who are coindesk advertiser's? Banks, fund managers? Petey also doesn't explain the risk to his followers and acts like, name your price and its a lock, these people can lose their homes! How f-ing irresponsible of this guy!

Next Burry announces his short position, left out of the story is that he has been short on tesla since December and maybe longer- What is not reported is that he did not use millions of dollars to short, he put up 8000. If he fails, and tesla doesn't go down he could lose millions of dollars

This whole crypto community is being used all because a bunch of fund managers and experts decided to take a company down long before Elon said one peep about DOGE or Bitcoin.

Both Bitcoin and DOGE are being used! SO called experts and the Media use Social Engineering - fear and tribalism - to get you emotional and to act in the direction they and their advertisers want you to act. They do this with stocks, they do this with crypto. Be aware.

To me, nothing says ""spying"" more than a *government issued wallet* address. This isn't REQUIRED for El Salvador as far as I know (yet), but it could become required later. I fear for people new to this will have a rough time if they think they'll have complete privacy if they are not fully informed. There is plenty of historical documentation about the difference of what governments say and what they do.

**Questions:**

* IMHO governments want maximum reach in all areas whether they admit that or not. Is using crypto inviting them in further than ever before?
* What ratio of governed wallets vs unknown wallets do you predict they will accept/tolerate?
* Is it plausible they later force the country to be monitored via government approved wallet addresses only?
* Does this mean governments will have the power to then ""shut off"" someone's wallet, thereby disabling the person from buying/selling? Say you are even suspected of a ""crime"" and are actually innocent, but your wallet address gets flagged and disabled? If so, what is to stop them from targeting an individual(s)? What could you do?

Yeah, it could be anyone's guess. And governments do these things already with fiat to an extent. With crypto it seems like the controls could be vastly more constricting.
